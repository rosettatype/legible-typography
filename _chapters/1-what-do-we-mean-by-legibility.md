title: What do we mean by legibility?
---

# [Broad definition](#broad-definition)

When I mentioned to a couple of people that I intended to write a text
on legibility they asked 'legibility of what?' The answer is legibility
of text, but the question may have been looking for a more specific
focus, i.e. what type of texts. The question also encouraged me to
reflect on a more general interpretation of legibility. For example, the
phrase from a dictionary which illustrates another use: ['an anxious mood
that was clearly legible upon her face'](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/legible) shows that we read people's
facial expressions and interpret their mood from these. Although it may
be intriguing to read faces, I intend to focus on reading text, and in
particular ease of reading.

Within typographic and graphic design, we might consider whether signs
are legible (in particular from a distance), whether we can decipher
small print (especially later in life), if icons can be easily
identified or recognised (without text labels), if a novel or textbook
is set in a readable type (encouraging us to read on). These questions
emphasise that it is not only the physical characteristics of the text
or symbol that need to be considered in determining whether or not the
designs are legible, or how legible they are. The purpose for reading,
the context of reading, and the characteristics of the reader also
determine legibility.

> Question: Is legibility a binary concept (i.e. legible or illegible) or
are there degrees of legibility, and perhaps also illegibility? If there
are degrees, how do we decide what is an acceptable level of legibility?
(We will return to this question in the final chapter.)
{: .question }

In describing various examples of designed objects, I have used
adjectives other than 'legible' to describe the ease of reading, e.g.
being identifiable, recognisable, or readable. These terms may be
helpful in conveying the general meaning of legibility but there are
circumstances where it is important to differentiate among them, and to
be more precise in our definition. For example, when evaluating
research, it is necessary to know what operational definition of
legibility has been used by the researchers. An operational definition
describes what is measured in the study ([see Chapter 4]({% link _chapters/4-what-is-measured-and-how.md %})).

# [Legibility, readability, and related concepts](#legibility-readability-and-related-concepts)

Another way of considering what is meant by legibility is to distinguish
it from related concepts. Starting with the initial sensation of an
image on our retina, part of our eye (see [Figure 2.2, Chapter 2]({% link _chapters/2-how-we-read.md %}#figure-2-2)), for
this image to register, it must be ['visible' or 'perceptible'](#sn:visible). If it
is too far away, for example, it will not be perceptible. We may
therefore consider visibility or perceptibility as a prerequisite for
legibility: if something is not visible, it cannot be legible. It may
not always be possible to make a clear distinction between where
perceptibility stops and legibility begins and this will become clearer
when reviewing the methods used to test legibility ([Chapter 4: Threshold
and related measures]({% link _chapters/4-what-is-measured-and-how.md %}#threshold-and-related-measures). I will therefore include perceptibility as part
of legibility.

<aside id="sn:visible">
Visible and perceptible are used interchangeably here. Perceptible is a less 
common word but introduces the process of perception, i.e. that a viewer or
reader is a necessary component.
</aside>

Another distinction can be made between legibility and readability. Some
authors, notably typographer, writer, and designer Walter Tracy, make
the point that legibility and readability of type are separate
attributes: legibility refers to the clarity of individual characters;
readability refers to the ease with which we comprehend a text ([Tracy 1986, p31]({% link pages/bibliography.md %}#tracy-1986)). 
Unfortunately this definition of readability can be rather
confusing as comprehension is influenced by typographic form, but also
the complexity of the content affects our understanding of a text. For
this reason, I am going to use a single concept, 'legibility', which
will cover:

**identifying individual characters, whole words, and reading text which
will usually refer to [continuous texts]({% link pages/glossary.md %}#continuous-text) for
extended reading, typically sentences arranged into paragraphs and
sections.**

This book is a good example of continuous text, although it is
interrupted by other text elements (e.g. lists) and illustrations. I
think it is too ambitious to expand the scope of this book to
non-continuous texts, such as tables, signs, and forms, but I will
mention signs from time-to-time.

I consider it important to update our definition of legibility to take
into account that we frequently read from screens. Text can be read in
print or on screen and usability may be a better way of describing the
ease of working with print or screen documents, which may be affected by
the layout or interface design. The term usability typically
incorporates navigation and other forms of interaction with the text, as
well as reading. Although I am focusing primarily on reading text and
legibility, there may be some overlap with usability. The important
point is to clarify what is measured in a study, rather than the
particular word used by the researchers as these may differ.

> Question: Which design variables might influence the legibility of this
book?
{: .question }

By offering a fairly loose, and rather general, description of
legibility, I wish to avoid getting too involved in analysing
differences among definitions. Instead, we might consider how
definitions highlight various characteristics or criteria and contribute
to a fuller description which encompasses how legibility is measured and
the context of reading. Panel 1.1 introduces several definitions from
different sources, and I will return to some of these in later chapters.

<aside class="panel" markdown="1" id="panel-1-1">

# Panel 1.1: Definitions of legibility

_The Concise Oxford dictionary_ lists two criteria:
- 'clear, capable of being read'

_The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary:_
- Of writing: plain, easily made out
- Of compositions: accessible to readers; also easy to read, readable

Reynolds and Simmonds ([1984, p1]({% link pages/bibliography.md %}#reynolds-simmonds-1984)) provide a fuller definition which
refers to the nature of the material and differentiates between ease and
speed:
- 'ease and speed of recognition of individual letters or numerals,
    and of words either singly or in the form of continuous text'

Zachrisson ([1965, p25]({% link pages/bibliography.md %}#zachrisson-1965)) incorporates comprehension and includes a measure
of accuracy:
- 'the speed and accuracy of visually receiving and comprehending
    meaningful running text'

Williamson ([1983, p378]({% link pages/bibliography.md %}#williamson-1983)) uses similar measures, but described in slightly
different ways, and also introduces an environmental factor referring to
the circumstances of reading:
- 'the ability to read comfortably, continuously and swiftly by
    intended reader in appropriate circumstances'

Finally, a very different way of considering legibility is offered by
Gill ([1931, p47]({% link pages/bibliography.md %}#gill-1931)):
- 'legibility, in practice, amounts simply to what one is accustomed
    to'

And subsequently Licko ([1990, p13]({% link pages/bibliography.md %}#licko-1990)) expressing the same sentiment:
- 'You read best what you read most'

# Evidence for legibility

It is therefore important to be critical of evidence that supports
particular positions. We should question what the evidence is and how it
was obtained. In the exercise above, you used your experience to make
judgements about legibility. These judgements are useful and sometimes
form part of legibility research.

An issue for discussion is whether designers can make claims concerning
legibility if they have no means of supporting their claim other than
their own judgement. I do not underestimate the value of professional
knowledge, craft experience, or practical design skills and training.
However, at the very least, I believe it is important to check that we
have not developed less than optimal ways of presenting text which may
be based on misguided notions of what readers find easiest to read.

> Question: In your opinion, what contribution can designers' judgements
make to determining what is most legible?
{: .question }

In this text I am going to focus on empirical research, commonly studies
testing different typographical arrangements on a group of participants.
Most of the research is based on adult reading but occasionally I
describe some studies which include children because the typography may
need to be different to cater for the developing reader.

# Why is legibility important?

Legibility focuses the designer on the functional characteristics of a
text to make a message accessible. There has been some opposition to
legibility research, or even prioritising functionality, but this tends
to be criticism of the methods used, and consequently what is measured
(discussed further in [Chapter 3]({% link _chapters/3-perspectives-on-legibility.md %}) 
and [4]({% link _chapters/4-what-is-measured-and-how.md %})). When the purpose is to convey a
message, one of the roles of typography is to support reading.

Legibility is one aspect of universal or inclusive design, which is
designing to meet the needs of people of diverse age and capability. In
the UK, the British Standards Institute introduced a standard in 2005
and defined inclusive design as:

> The design of mainstream products and/or services that is accessible to,
and usable by, people with the widest range of abilities within the
widest range of situations without the need for special adaptation or
design.\
_British Standards Institute ([2005, p4]({% link pages/bibliography.md %}#british-standards-institute-2005))_

By designing legible material, we are supporting the ability of people
to complete activities and tasks. The [Web Accessibility
Initiative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/usable) explains the close
relationship between accessibility, usability, and inclusive design.

# Functionality versus aesthetics

A classic lecture given by Beatrice Warde in 1930 presents the case for
'invisible type', meaning the reader should not notice the
characteristics of the type (Warde, 1930 in [Armstrong, 2009, p41]({% link pages/bibliography.md %}#armstrong-2009)) as
these may detract from [communicating the message](#sn:warde-readability). This ideal appears to be in opposition to
aesthetic considerations, if we interpret aesthetics as the creation of
a beautiful text which draws attention to the typography. However, an
alternative proposition is that legible text is also aesthetically
pleasing. Therefore, legibility and aesthetics need not be seen as
opposing aims in the design of continuous text.

<aside id="sn:warde-readability">
I am ignoring Warde’s point that readability is desirable, but not legibility 
(as a larger and bolder type might be more legible, but not more readable). 
This apparent contradiction stems from the distinction (already described) 
between individual characters and continuous text.
</aside>

> ...all designing — whether a car, a coffee pot, or a typeface — is a
process in which two aspects should combine and balance: the object must
work well, and it must look well.\
_Tracy replying to Donald E. Knuth\'s article "The concept of a
meta-font", ([1982, p355]({% link pages/bibliography.md %}#tracy-1982))_

Another view of the relationship between functionality and aesthetics is
that typefaces have both these roles: a functional role relating to
legibility; and an aesthetic or semantic role which determines whether
the typeface is suitable for certain purposes because of the meaning
conveyed by the visual form. This second role has been described using
different terms: atmosphere value, congeniality, semantic qualities, and
personality. More recently research has extended beyond typefaces to
look at impressions gained from different typographic layouts, and
'interaction aesthetics' which are emotions emerging from interacting
with products.

> Question: Are there some objects or systems created by graphic designers
where aesthetic considerations may be more important than legibility?
{: .question }

**Exercise:** rank the three examples ([Figures 1.1A](#figure-1-1A), [1.1B](#figure-1-1B), [1.1C](#figure-1-1C)) according
to your judgement of their legibility with 1 the most legible and 3 the
least legible. Now rank the same three examples according to your
aesthetic judgement with 1 the most pleasing.

<figure id="figure-1-1A">
    <img src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/FIG-1-1-A.png' | relative_url }}" alt="">
    <figcaption>Figure 1.1A</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure id="figure-1-1B">
    <img src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/FIG-1-1-B.png' | relative_url }}" alt="">
    <figcaption>Figure 1.1B</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure id="figure-1-1C">
    <img src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/FIG-1-1-C.png' | relative_url }}" alt="">
    <figcaption>Figure 1.1C</figcaption>
</figure>

You may find that your judgements of legibility coincide with your
judgements of what is the most aesthetically pleasing.

Now do the same set of two rankings for these 3: [Figures 1.2A](#figure-1-2A), [1.2B](#figure-1-2B), [1.2C](#figure-1-2C).


<figure id="figure-1-2A">
    <img src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/FIG-1-2-A.png' | relative_url }}" alt="">
    <figcaption>Figure 1.2A</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure id="figure-1-2B">
    <img src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/FIG-1-2-B.png' | relative_url }}" alt="">
    <figcaption>Figure 1.2B</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure id="figure-1-2C">
    <img src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/FIG-1-2-C.png' | relative_url }}" alt="">
    <figcaption>Figure 1.2C</figcaption>
</figure>

I have included this second set of examples to demonstrate that
legibility and aesthetics may not always coincide. This may seem to
contradict my proposition above, but I include it to illustrate that
demonstrations can be quite convincing, until a counter example is
provided that is equally convincing.

# Summary

When applied to reading, legibility has been described in many ways and
there are disagreements about:

-   whether or not it should apply only to individual characters

-   how it is distinguished from readability (or other related terms)

-   its relationship with aesthetics

-   how relevant legibility research is to practice

If you are informed about the legibility research that has been done,
why it has been done, how it has been done, and what the outcomes are,
you are in a position to evaluate its contribution to your design
thinking and practice. I therefore encourage you to read on.
