# Rationale

You may question why it is necessary for graphic or typographic
designers to know about the mechanics of reading, which would seem to be
the responsibility of scientists, [particularly psychologists](#sn:particularly-psychologists). In
order to know what makes a text more legible, we could limit ourselves
to finding out about the results of specific legibility studies. But to
understand why something may be harder to read, we need to have some
knowledge of how we read, in particular the early visual perceptual
processes in reading. This stage of identifying letters and words has
been described as the perceptual processes of pattern recognition, and
this is where design decisions (determining the visual characteristics
of letters or lines of text on a page or screen) can have an effect. The
written word has been described as a visual object and a linguistic
entity ([Grainger, 2016](#ref:grainger-2016)). Designers may not be so concerned about the
linguistic entity but considering words as visual objects seems key to
the role of a typographer or graphic designer. As a psychologist, I am
interested in how specific typographic variables affect how we read. I
believe this is also very useful information for designers.

<aside id="sn:particularly-psychologists">
The applied psychologist Poulton ([1965](#ref:poulton-1965)) was aware of this confound and
adjusted sizes accordingly. His example has not been followed by all
researchers, possibly due to a lack of awareness or technical
limitations.

## Eye movement

A lot of our knowledge of the reading process comes from studies of eye
movements. Our eyes do not move along lines of text in a smooth gradual
way. Instead, our eyes make 'saccades', which are very quick jumps from
one point to another, typically jumping 7 to 9 letters ([Figure 2.1](#figure-2-1)).
During these movements we have no vision; the vision takes place in the
pauses or fixations between saccades. These tend to last about 200 to
250 msecs (a quarter of a second). The time spent in pauses is about 90%
of the time. When we get to the end of a line, we make a return sweep to
the beginning (or close to the beginning) of the next line. If we do not
read something properly, we make a 'regression' which is where we go
back to an earlier point. When we make these saccades, we position our
eyes so that part of the text falls on the area of maximum acuity on our
retina; this area is called the fovea ([see [Figure 2.2](#figure-2-2)](#figure-2-2)). At normal
reading distances about 6 or 7 letters fall onto the fovea; adjacent to
this is the parafovea and peripheral vision. We have an area of
effective vision during a fixation, sometimes referred to as the
'perceptual span', and we make use of letters surrounding the 6 or 7
letters. When reading from left to right, the span typically covers 3 or
4 letter spaces to the left of fixation and 14 or 15 to the right ([see
Figure 2.3](#figure-2-3)). However, this is not fixed as, for example, beginning
readers have a smaller span and text difficulty reduces the span
([Rayner, 1986](#ref:rayner-1986)).

out how we read? Are we able to report on our own reading?

## How do we recognise words?

There is broad agreement amongst reading researchers that word
recognition is letter-based. What we are doing in the pauses or
fixations is identifying letters and these are combined into words.

### Word shape re-examined

        <figcaption>

        (capitals) with ascenders and descenders creating an outline in lower case.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
</aside>

However, many texts on typography refer to the use of word shape
information, suggesting that we recognise words from their outline
shape, e.g. the pattern of ascenders and descenders ([see [Figure 2.4](#figure-2-4)](#figure-2-4)).
This comes from an outdated model, originally proposed in 1886 by a
psychologist, James Cattell. Classic texts connected with legibility
include references to word shape, as this was probably the current, or
reasonably current, thinking based on psychological literature at the
time of publication. Spencer wrote: 'Perception in normal reading is by
word wholes...'([Spencer, 1968, p20](#ref:spencer-1968)). Unfortunately, this view is
perpetuated in more recently published literature making it important
that we critically evaluate what we read.



At an Association Typographique Internationale conference in September
2003, Kevin Larson (a reading psychologist working in Microsoft
Corporation's Advanced Reading Technology Group) spoke of the
significant discrepancy between recent psychological models of reading
(supported by evidence) and typographers' beliefs and understanding.
[Panel 2.1](#panel-2-1) based on Larson ([2004](#ref:larson-2004)), explains where the support for word
shape came from.

> Question: Why do you think the belief that word shape is important in
reading persisted for a long time and is still held by some people?
{: .question }

<aside class="panel" markdown="1" id="panel-2-1">

# Panel 2.1: Explanation of where the support for word shape came from

> Why did the outline formed by the word shape seem to be convincing as an
explanation for how we recognise words?

The first four sources of evidence for word shape are provided by Larson
(before he knocks them down). The fifth comes from an Internet text and
the source is not entirely certain.

1. Cattell ([1886](#ref:cattell)) discovered the 'word superiority effect' where word
naming is easier than letter naming. He found out by presenting either
letters or words to participants for a short time (5–10ms) and more
words were accurately recognised than letters. This led to the logical
assumption that written words are identified using holistic word shape
information.
<br>

> BUT this effect can be attributed to regular letter combinations, rather
than word shape.

2. Further support for word shape appeared to come from the finding
that lower case text is read faster than all upper case text. The
outline shape of lower case appears to be much more informative ([Figure
2.4](#figure-2-4)).
<br>

> BUT one explanation for this is that it is a practice effect because we
are used to reading lower case and are therefore more proficient and
read it faster (see Chapter 5: Upper versus lower case)

3. Proof reading errors can be more easily detected if the error
changes the word shape:

<div class="columns-3">
    <div>
        <img src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/2-panel-2-1-A.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Word shape effect: many">
        <small>correct spelling: many</small>

    <div>
        <img src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/2-panel-2-1-B.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Word shape effect: manj">
        <small>incorrect spelling with same word shape: manj</small>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/2-panel-2-1-C.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Word shape effect: mano">
        <small>incorrect spelling with different word shape: mano</small>
    </div>
</div>

> BUT these results were found to be caused by changes to letter shapes,
and not word shapes. In the original studies ([Haber and Schindler, 1981](#ref:haber-schindler-1981);
[Monk and Hulme, 1983](#ref:monk-hulme-1983)), the word and letter shapes were confounded,
meaning that changes to the word shapes also changed letter shapes. It
was therefore not possible to separate the two explanations. A
subsequent study ([Paap, Newsome, and Noel, 1984](#ref:paap-newsome-noel-1984)) changed word shape and
letter shape independently and identified that errors that retain the
same letter shapes are more difficult to detect in proofreading than
errors where the letter shapes are different. The word shape is not
relevant.

1. It is more difficult to read text in AlTeRnAtInGg case than not in
alternating case. The explanation for this is that we lose the familiar
word shape when alternating case.

> BUT this effect is also true for [pseudowords]({{ site.baseurl }}/glossary#pseudoword) that we have
not encountered before and therefore the word shape would not be
familiar.

1. Another demonstration that seems to support word shape was contained
in a text circulating on the Internet in 2003 (with my correction).

*Which reads as:*

> According to a researcher at Cambridge University, it doesn't matter in
what order the letters in a word are, the only important thing is that
the first and last letter be at the right place. The rest can be a total
mess and you can still read it without problem. This is because the
human mind does not read every letter by itself but the word as a
whole.

Although this claimed to come from Cambridge University, a researcher,
[Matt David](https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/people/matt.davis/cmabridge/), at the MRC Cognition and Brain Science Unit, Cambridge
University, UK tracked down the original demonstration of the effect of
letter randomisation to a [PhD thesis](#sn:rawlinson). As David explains, although
some of the content is partially correct, there are also misleading
statements.

Demonstrations, such as this jumbled text, can appear quite convincing
because they can be manipulated to support whatever claim is being made
-- here the claim that this is a readable text. Although it might appear
to support the argument for reading words as wholes (and not by letter),
another explanation, supported by more recent research and based on
letters and not words, is given by Grainger and Whitney ([2004](#ref:grainger-whitney-2004)). If the
jumbled words contain the same letters, small changes can be made to the
letter order (called transpositions) and we can still identify the words
because there is sufficient information on the correct relative position
of letters.

TODO Aoccdrnig => According

In fact, we are slowed down by reading sentences with transposed letters
-- a demonstration cannot reveal such subtle effects. Some
transpositions are more problematic than others ([Rayner, White, Johnson and Liversedge, 2006](#ref:rayner-white-johnson-liversedge-2006)). 
If internal letters are transposed (e.g. reading
becomes readnig or redaing) we are not slowed down as much as when
beginning or end letters are transposed. Changing the order of letters
beginning the words is the most disruptive (e.g. word becoming owrd).

**Exercise:** Take the jumbled paragraph:

> Aoccdrnig to a rscheearer at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it deosn't mttaer in
waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoetnt tihng is taht

wlohe.

Can you re-arrange each word so that it becomes problematic to read
trying not to move a lot more letters than in the original jumble? Is it
still possible to read some words if the beginning and end letters are
transposed?

### Parallel letter recognition

As skilled readers, we identify individual letters in parallel
(simultaneously) rather than sequentially (one after the other). We
therefore need to not only work out what the letters are but also their
order within words, using word spaces to identify the word boundaries.
This information is used to match against stored words to derive meaning
and/or sound (pronunciation). See [Panel 2.2](#panel-2-2) for a distinction between
silent reading and reading aloud.

<aside id="panel-2-2" class="panel" markdown="1">

# Panel 2.2: Theory on distinction between silent reading and reading aloud

Recent work ([Grainger, Dufau and Ziegler, 2016](#ref:grainger-dufau-ziegler-2016)) proposes a theoretical
framework which incorporates two routes from letters to words:\

1. We might go directly from the letters to meaning, a faster but not
necessarily entirely accurate route as the precise letter positions may
not be known. Instead subsets of letters may be used that help to
identify a unique word, and these may not be adjacent letters. If
reading silently, this route might be sufficient for our needs.\

2. The second route generates sound from the text, using more precise
positioning of letters, and we need this route for reading aloud. We
read aloud more slowly than silent reading.

In learning to read we start letter-by-letter, one after the other,
unlike the parallel processing of skilled readers. The beginning reader
identifies individual letters and learns the corresponding sounds of
individual letters and combinations. At this stage they will know the
letters of the alphabet and have a spoken vocabulary. Their task is to
bring these together. This mapping is thought to set up the connections
that exist for skilled readers ([Grainger, Lété, Bertand, Dufau, and Ziegler, 2012](#ref:grainger-lete-bertand-dufau-ziegler-2012)).

</aside>



The space between letters is also important as letters are less visible
when surrounded by other letters. This is referred to as 'crowding', and
is not specific to letters. The effect of crowding is greater in our
peripheral vision, which means we are less able to recognise words
further from the fovea. This is due to reduced visual acuity and
crowding. Words are recognised from their parts (i.e. letters) and
crowding reduces our ability to identify the individual letters as the
adjacent letters jumble their appearance.

This also happens with faces. If we look at a face using our peripheral
vision, it may be difficult to work out if the person is frowning or
smiling. The context of the face hinders our perception. If the mouth
alone were shown to us in peripheral vision, without the face context,
it would be easier to work out if it was a frown or smile. If we look at
someone using our central vision (in front of us), having the whole face
is an advantage. Box 2.1 describes the research and hopefully
demonstrates this effect.



## Word context

A large amount of research into how we read has used isolated letters
and words that are not in the context of sentences. These studies might
therefore be criticised for using artificial test material which does
not reflect 'normal reading'. ([Chapter 4](TODO) will discuss the reasons for
the choice of methods in more detail). We usually read words in
sentences and this context can help us to predict what word may follow.
The description of crowding above has also shown that context can have a
negative effect (in peripheral vision). A psychological study has looked
at the relative contribution of letters, words, and sentence context to
how fast we read ([Pelli and Tillman, 2007](#ref:pelli-tillman-2007)). They found that letters
contribute most to reading rate (62%); words contribute only 16% and
sentence context contributes the remaining 22%. Word shape therefore
plays a very small part in [reading](#sn:word-shape). The research is described in [Box 2.2](#box-2-2).

<aside id="word-shape">The ways in which beginning readers are taught to read are influenced by
the different theoretical positions and assumptions or beliefs about how
we read, which have changed over time, influenced by research findings.
Letter-by-letter decoding is taught through practice in phonics; the
whole-word method involves memorising some words; the whole language
method encourages children to use story and sentence context to guess
the next word (which will only work some of the time).</aside>

# Box 2.1: Details of 'face inferiority' effect

A rather interesting series of studies asked the question as to whether
faces are processed like words. Do we identify a word or face as a whole
or by its parts? By now you will know the answer to how we recognise
words: by identifying the individual letters.

The researchers ([Martelli, Majaj and Pelli, 2005](#ref:martelli-majaj-pelli-2005)) include a
demonstration of the effects which I hope you will be able to experience
for yourself in [Figure 2.5](#figure-2-5). They refer to these as the 'word
inferiority' and 'face inferiority' effects. You may remember that
Cattell invented the 'word superiority' effect ([Panel 2.1](#panel-2-1)). Here we have
more evidence that argues against word superiority and reading by word
shape.

In [Figure 2.5](#figure-2-5), at the top you have the word inferiority effect. If you
focus on the square in the middle and try to identify the middle letter
on the left, you may find that it is difficult to do. If you again focus
on the square and try to identify the letter on the right, it should be
much easier to do. Similarly for the face, focus on the square in the
centre and see if you can tell whether the face is smiling or frowning.
Then do the same for the mouth on the left. You may find that it is much
easier to tell whether you see frowning or smiling when there is no
context (the face).

<figure id="figure-2-5">
    <figcaption>Figure 2.5: These images demonstrate the effect of context or crowding
on letters and faces. You need to use your peripheral vision by focusing
on the square in the middle. On the left, the letter or mouth is shown
in the context of other letters or the face. This context which makes it
more difficult to accurately perceive them compared to the items out of
context shown on the right.</figcaption>

# Box 2.2: Details of contributions to reading from letters, words, and
sentences

The way the researchers calculated how much letters, words and sentences
contribute to reading was to systematically remove each source of
information. Sentence information was removed by changing word order
(Figure 2.6a); word shape information was distorted by alternating case
(Figure 2.6b); letters were substituted for similar shapes so that the
whole word shape was preserved (Figure 2.6c). The reading rates at which
participants achieved an accuracy of 80% (i.e. 20% of words were
incorrectly reported) were measured for all combinations of these three
methods. They didn't just remove one at a time, but also removed two
cues (e.g. just having word information, removing letters and sentence
information). An example from their paper:\
\

If we add back the letter and sentence information, it reads as:

# Identification of letter features

</figcaption>
</figure>
</aside>

Given the importance of identifying letters, quite a lot of research has
looked into what features of letters we use to distinguish one letter
from another. However, models of reading have assumed that the
particular font will not affect the basic results ([McClelland and Rumelhart, 1981, p383](#ref:mcclelland-rumelhart-1981)). Many models use a font with straight-line
segments, created by Rumelhart and Siple ([1974](#ref:rumelhart-siple-1974)) which disregards typical
letter shapes (see [Figure 2.7](#figure-2-7)). However, there is now a greater focus on
letter perception by psychologists which must be good for typographers.
The outcomes of these studies are described in Chapter 5 where they are
combined with research from a design perspective.


## Reading different typefaces and handwriting

The research on letter features looks for characteristics that are
shared by all letter  <code>a</code>s and letter <code>b</code>s etc., such as mid segments or
stroke terminals (see [Chapter 5: Letter features](TODO)). A skilled reader can
recognise most letters quickly regardless of the visual form, which can
mean the font, case (capital letters and small letters), or style of
handwriting,

<aside>
    <figure id="figure-2-8">
        <img src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/FIG-2-8.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Letter identification">
        <figcaption>Figure 2.8: Readers identify the letter b even though it can take many
    shapes and sizes.</figcaption>
    </figure>
</aside>

Despite these differences in the visual forms of the same letter, we can
easily identify letters, recognising them as representing the same
character. We are creating abstract letter identities ([Grainger, Rey and Dufau, 2008](#grainger-rey-dufau-2008)), where the letter is identified as <code>a</code> or <code>b</code> irrespective
of font, size or case ([Besner, Coltheart and Davelaar, 1984](#ref:besner-coltheart-davelaar-1984)). Figure 2.8
illustrates this mapping of different forms onto a single
representation. How we do this, and identify letters despite their
different forms, was proposed by a psychologist about 30 years ago
([Sanocki, 1987](#ref:sanocki-1987), [1988](#ref:sanocki-1988)). He referred to this as 'font tuning'.

It is often assumed that once we have converted to an abstract letter
identity, we no longer retain knowledge of the visual form, because this
is not essential to reading. Some exceptions to this are when we wish
to:

-   identify the typeface (something that typographic and graphic
    designers may wish to do)

-   recognise whose handwriting we are looking at

-   identify brand names and corporate identities

[Panel 2.3](#panel-2-3) provides a little more detail of font tuning and research
which looks at how we recognise letters using neuroscience techniques.

<aside class="panel" id="panel-2-3" markdown="1">

# Panel 2.3: Font tuning and neuroscience research

Essentially, we can use the characteristics of a particular font or
style of handwriting to help us identify letters and convert from the
visual form containing specific properties of that font (variants of the
same character) to abstract representations (invariant forms). This
happens extremely quickly from recognising the form as a letter
(100–200msecs) to recognising the specific letter (120–180msecs) to
abstracting the invariant form (220msecs) to indicating recognition
(after 300msecs). ([Rey, Dufau, Massol and Grainger, 2009](#ref:rey-dufau-massol-grainger-2009) cited in
[Thiessen, Kohler, Churches, Coussens, and Keage, 2015](#ref:thiessen-kohler-churches-coussens-keage-2015)).

Some recent research using neuroscience tools and methodologies suggests
that the visual form of letters may have an effect after abstract
information is extracted ([Keage, Coussens, Kohler, Thiessen and Churches, 2014](#ref:keage-cussens-kohler-thiessen-churches-2014)), 
even though we don't necessarily need to remember a typeface.

identification as we need to re-tune letter by letter.

# Summary

Typographers and graphic designers were led to believe that we read by
identifying words from their outline shape. This was once the view held
by psychologists, but research improves our understanding and it is
important to update our knowledge. We know a lot about reading from:

-   monitoring eye movements

-   using sophisticated techniques to see which parts of letters we use
    to differentiate letters

-   working out how sentence and word information contribute in positive
    (providing context) or negative (crowding) ways

There is a greater interest developing among scientists in looking at
different visual forms, not just assuming all letters are equal so the
font or case doesn't matter. Recent psychological research is
demonstrating a greater sensitivity to typography which will be of great
benefit to designers. This is described further in the next chapter.
