Version 1.0 was published and printed in January 2019, designed by [Carlos Pérez Cerón](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Carlos-Perez-Ceron), with [María González de Cossío](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-gonzalez-de-coss%C3%ADo-a1272b76/) as the editor.

Version 2.0 has some edits based on feedback from Kevin Larson: a reference to CAPTCHAs is removed; the results of studies on ClearType are clarified; letter frequency is included as a further factor in legibility; a distinction is made between  critical type size and optimal type size; a more recent study on letter, word, and line spacing is added; earlier research on disfluency is included. This version was further revised for presentation on this website; the project is sponsored by [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), produced by [Rosetta Type](https://rosettatype.com), and implemented by [Johannes Neumeier](https://underscoretype.com).
