# Mary C. Dyson

Mary studied psychology as an undergraduate and
then went on to complete a PhD in auditory perception.
Soon after this, through serendipity, she became a
lecturer in the Department of Typography & Graphic
Communication at the University of Reading, UK. The
transition seems somewhat unusual but the position
was linked to the  eld of Electronic Publishing, as it was
called in the 1980s. Mary’s research training had
included working with computers and these skills were
helpful in her new role. As a consequence, Mary’s early
research was focused on reading from screen and the
e ects of typographic variables on reading speed,
reading strategies, and comprehension, closely related
to legibility. This developed into looking at how we
read which required a focus on individual letters and
typeface characteristics.

Lacking any design training, Mary’s teaching covered
the theory of typography and research methods,
drawing heavily on psychology. Over a period of 30 or
so years, she has supervised around twenty PhD
students whose research spans a range of topics. These
supervisory experiences have been incredibly rewarding,
challenging, stimulating and have led to some
valuable friendships. They have also informed and
shaped Mary’s approach to interdisciplinary work,
helping remove barriers between her psychological
approach and design practice. We hope this is evident
in the way the book is written.
Mary has now retired from academic life, though still
pursuing the occasional project.

Centre for Advanced Studies in Design
The Centre for Advanced Studies in Design
was founded in the city of Cholula, Puebla
in December 2003 as a non-profit organisation
in pursuit of design development.
One of its objectives is to improve
professional and academic design levels
searching for the consolidation of the
discipline. In this way, the Centre publishes
this collection of essays to support design
students and professionals in knowing more
about their area of study and providing a
stronger basis for their professional
endeavour.

The Centre for Advanced Studies in Design is
devoted to four specific areas as teaching,
research, consultancy and publishing.
