TBD could add links to the people here :)
## My thanks go to:
- Sofie Beier for providing me with her typefaces for some of my
illustrations
- Jeanne-Louise Moys for sharing illustrations of her test material
and reading a draft
- David Brezina for answering my queries on typefaces,
terminology and more
- Carlos Pérez Cerón who did an amazing job in interpreting my
suggestions
- María González de Cossío for sensing that this project was
just what I needed and who was patient and supportive
throughout
