# Historical perspective

<aside id="sn:pedagogy-of-reading" markdown="1">
A review of Huey’s book ([Buchner, 1909]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#buchner-1909)) referred to the mix of science and practice, something which I am also aspiring to do. However, my text combines science (primarily psychology) with design practice whereas Huey focused on the practice of teaching reading. Nevertheless he also discusses issues of legibility.
</aside>

What are the origins of legibility research? A few landmarks are worth
reporting as they formed the foundations for subsequent research and are
frequently cited. Various writers ([Spencer, 1968]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#spencer-1968); 
[Rehe, 1979]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#rehe-1979); 
[Tinker, 1965]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#tinker-1965)) propose that 
scientific legibility research began with Javal
around 1880, a French ophthalmologist who studied eye movements in
reading. In particular, Huey wrote a book on [*The psychology and pedagogy of reading*](#sn:pedagogy-of-reading) in 1908 ([reprinted 1968]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#huey-1908-1968)) which credits Javal
with discovering the pattern of eye movements in reading (described in
[Chapter 2]({% link _chapters_en/2-how-we-read.md %})).


Closer examination of the original sources by psychologists reveals a
different story ([Wade, Tatler and Heller, 2003]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#wade-tatler-heller-2003)). In 1879, a physiologist
Hering first discovered that reading involves saccadic eye movements and
Lamare in 1892, a colleague of Javal, noted the jerky, rather than
continuous, movements. Dodge (a psychologist) was able to develop a
photographic technique which enabled more accurate measures of the speed
of saccades and the length of fixations. These developments were the
start of eye movement recording technologies.

Shortly after the discoveries concerning eye movements, Cattell ([1886]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#cattell-1886))
claimed to have found the word superiority effect (as mentioned in
[Chapter 2]({% link _chapters_en/2-how-we-read.md %})). Other work around this time that is often cited includes:

-   which letters are more legible than other letters ([Sanford, 1888]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#sanford-1888);
    [Roethlein, 1912]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#roethlein-1912))

-   a review of early legibility research by Pyke ([1926]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#pyke-1926))

# Research directions

Although the above research looking at visual mechanisms in reading
began in the late nineteenth century, [visual science]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#visual-or-vision-science) moved away from [applied research]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#applied-research) and therefore lost a connection with
legibility research. The psychology of reading became the province of
cognitive psychology, education, and psycholinguistics with less
interest in typographic and graphic aspects of text. From around 1980,
computational models of reading were developed aiming to simulate the
recognition of words through mathematical modelling with computers.

An extensive programme of legibility research was conducted by Tinker
and his colleagues, which did not attempt to explain the underlying
visual mechanisms for the results. To some extent, this reflected the
state of knowledge at that time, and separation of theoretical and
applied research. 'Theoretical*', '*basic*'* or ['pure' research]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#pure-research) has the aim of investigating the visual
processes involved in reading whereas applied research aims to evaluate
which typographic solutions are better for reading. Tinker and
colleagues carried out numerous experiments between the 1920s and 1950s
which provide a substantial body of findings. Given our current
knowledge of how we read, and more recent interest in visual processing
relevant to legibility ([Legge, 2007, p108]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#legge-2007)), these results from
traditional legibility research can now be more thoroughly evaluated and
interpreted.

Reviews of legibility research summarise what is known at the time by
discussing research published by others, and which might also include
research by the author (e.g. [Ovink, 1938]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#ovink-1938); [Tinker, 1963]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#tinker-1963), [1965]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#tinker-1965);
[Zachrisson, 1965]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#zachrisson-1965); [Spencer, 1968]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#spencer-1968); [Foster, 1980]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#foster-1980); [Reynolds, 1984]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#reynolds-1984); [Lund, 1999]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#lund-1999); [Dyson, 2005]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#dyson-2005); [Beier, 2012]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#beier-2012)). These can be useful texts for gaining an overview of research findings, which should again be critically evaluated.

# Design perspective

Legibility research has not typically been carried out by designers, as
they are unlikely to have a detailed knowledge of scientific method,
normally acquired over the course of a psychology degree. However,
designers have views on what should be researched and how it should be
researched. These views do not necessarily fit with scientific
approaches to research. The objectives of the research usually differ
across disciplines and these can determine the methods used.

The primary method used by the psychologist concerned with reading
research is empirical experimentation ([Rayner and Pollatsek, 1989, p8]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#rayner-pollatsek-1989)).
Within the psychology of reading there are various perspectives
including cognitive and linguistic constructs (e.g. [Kintsch and van Dijk, 1978]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#kintsch-van-dijk-1978)), perceptual factors related to text legibility (e.g. [Tinker, 1963]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#tinker-1963), [1965]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#tinker-1965)), and the nature of visual information processing in reading (e.g. [Legge, 2007]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#legge-2007)).

A designer's primary motivation is to make text more legible, i.e.
easier to read, and also aesthetically pleasing — a practical approach.
Designers often express dissatisfaction with certain aspects of
empirical research, typically carried out by psychologists without
consulting designers. Many of the reasons, raised in the past and still
debated, are reviewed and summarised by Lund ([1999]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#lund-1999)) and Beier ([2016]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#beier-2016)).
Below I list a few of these criticisms (from a design standpoint) of
legibility research and then try to address these criticisms. These
focus on the value and the relevance of the research to design practice.
Issues which relate to the research methods are dealt with in the next
chapter.

-   _A fundamental position opposing legibility research argues that
    research inhibits creativity, which seems to assume that the
    outcomes of research must be implemented. Poynor ([1999, p14]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#poynor-1999))
    suggests that designers view the scientific approach as an opponent
    of the creative process, and do not wish to be led by psychologists._

    -   In 1970, Merald E. Wrolstad, editor of the *Journal of Typographic
        Research* speaking about the misunderstandings between disciplines,
        pointed out that research will never replace the creative designer;
        not everyone wants to be a typographer. Research should be regarded
        as a source of ideas ([Wrolstad, 1970, p37–38]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#wrolstad-1970)). 
        A solution may therefore be for designers to familiarise themselves with legibility
        research and then consider whether it is helpful to them in
        informing design practice. This does require researchers to present
        their work in an accessible form, and ideally including a hint as to
        how the findings might translate into practice, if relevant.

-   _Results of much legibility research merely confirm existing
    practices, based on craft knowledge. Or, results are contradictory
    and therefore of little use._

    -   If empirical research supports existing practice, this can be seen
        as positive and reassuring. Where there are discrepancies, either
        between existing practice and research or among different studies,
        there is more cause for concern. Such issues may be resolved with
        further well-planned studies.

-   _Researchers naturally focus on areas and questions which interest
    them ([Wrolstad, 1969, p116]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#wrolstad-1969)), 
    which may not be particularly relevant to design practice._

    -   Some research (such as the studies in [Chapter 2]({% link _chapters_en/2-how-we-read.md %})) is not intended to
        have direct relevance to design practice. [Pure research]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#pure-research) falls into this category. When reading
        about a study, it is important to work out why the research was
        done, which should be found in the introduction. The affiliations of
        the authors may also indicate their discipline if attached to a
        university or research centre and these are commonly included in the
        journal article (see [Figure 3.1](#figure-3-1)).

-   _Researchers should not look for universal truths but aim to provide
    practical decision-making guidance ([MacDonald-Ross and Waller, 1975, p77]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#macdonald-ross-waller-1975))._

    -   Practical guidance may require testing a specific version of a
        design, which is better described as formative evaluation or
        user/usability testing, rather than legibility research. The results
        will apply to the particular situation and will not be
        generalizable. (See [Chapter 4: Different types of testing and
        research]({% link _chapters_en/4-what-is-measured-and-how.md %}#different-types-of-testing-and-research)).

-   _Researchers choose topics that are easy to investigate in the
    laboratory ([MacDonald-Ross and Waller, 1975, p76]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#macdonald-ross-waller-1975))_

    -   This may have been true in 1975 and earlier, but I do not believe
        that this is currently the case as very sophisticated techniques
        have been developed. However, most of the research is done under
        controlled conditions (i.e. a 'laboratory setting'). This is covered
        in more detail in [Chapter 4]({% link _chapters_en/4-what-is-measured-and-how.md %}).

# Combining resources across disciplines

Collaboration between people with diverse backgrounds and expertise can
lead to mutual understanding of the important and different contribution
that comes from another discipline. Engaging in discussion can help us
understand the other's viewpoint which should make us less dismissive of
alternative perspectives.

**Exercise:**

Fernand Baudin (1918–2005), a Belgian book designer, author,
typographer, and teacher, objected to Tinker's description of
typographers as aesthetes when reviewing the book 'Bases for effective
reading' ([Baudin, 1967]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#baudin-1967)). I have extracted excerpts from the pages listed by Baudin, which I think are the parts in the book that he references.

> Consider whether you think Baudin was justified in being upset by the
statements (quotations) below from Tinker's book.
<br><br>
Do you think Baudin was right in interpreting the statements as: '...all
typographers en bloc, whether expert or not, are presented merely as
introspective aesthetes deserving, on the whole, of contempt'
([p204–205]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#baudin-1967)).
<br><br>
Is Tinker criticising typographers with these statements?<br>
Is it an insult to be concerned with aesthetics?
{: .question }

-   'Before scientific research, printers and type designers were
    concerned mainly with the esthetic appearance of the printed page.'
    (p115)

-   '...the dominant guides to typography until rather recently were
    esthetics, economy of printing, and traditional practice.' (p125)\
    'The subjective opinions of type designers and typographers as to
    legibility of letters prevailed throughout the nineteenth century
    and have carried much weight even up to the present day.' (p125)

-   'This practice continues even though many typography "experts"
    consider that italic type is far less legible than regular Roman
    lower case'. (p135)

-   'Although some designers may have a strong esthetic objection to
    boldface for headings, this does not mean that readers react the
    same way.' (p136)

-   'The strong belief that generous margins will increase legibility
    agrees with the opinions of most "experts" expressed between 1883
    and 1911 ([Pyke, 1926]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#pyke-1926)) (p183)

-   'While there is an "average" consensus, printing practice in use of
    margins in individual books varies greatly ([Paterson and Tinker, 1940]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#paterson-tinker-1940)). 
    Whether this is motivated by an attempt to produce a more
    pleasing page or by an unconscious departure from the 50 per cent
    rule, or both, is uncertain.' (p183) \[The 50 per cent rule refers
    to the general practice of publishers to use 50 per cent of a page
    for margins ([Tinker, 1965, p182]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#tinker-1965))\].

If we look at the above quotations from a more neutral perspective, we
might suggest that Tinker was wishing to make a clear distinction
between scientific research (admittedly, his own) and the craft
knowledge of typographic experts. The comments are not limited to
aesthetics as legibility is included. However, it is unfortunate that
Tinker uses quotation marks around the word "experts" which might be
seen as an ironic comment.

Fortunately, we have moved on from Tinker and recognise that combining
skills and knowledge across disciplines can result in more relevant and
[robust research]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#robust-research). An example of an excellent
collaboration between vision scientist and type designer is the article
illustrated in [Figure 3.1](#figure-3-1) and described in [Panel 3.1](#panel-3-1). 
Other examples of collaborations where design expertise combines with scientific knowledge
include:

-   *James Hartley and Peter Burnhill:*\
    Burnhill was a teacher of typography (1923—2007) who engaged in a
    long collaboration with James Hartley, a psychologist at Keele
    University, UK who is still a very active researcher and writer.
    This duo explored how typography can support readers' use of texts
    through clearly displaying the structure of the texts (e.g. use of
    space).

-   *Robert A. Morris, Kathy Aquilante, Charles Bigelow, and Dean Yager:*\
    In 2002, vision scientists (Aquilante and Yager) combined with a
    mathematician working in computer science (Morris) and type designer
    (Bigelow) to look at how serifs affect reading on screen.

-   *Owen Churches, Scott Coussens, Hannah Keage, Mark Kohler, and Myra
    Thiessen:*\
    Thiessen is a designer with knowledge of how to conduct experiments;
    all the other members of the team are neuropsychologists and
    together they have looked at how the brain processes typography
    using EEG (electroencephalography) technology. Their research is
    mentioned in [Panel 2.3]({% link _chapters_en/2-how-we-read.md %}#panel-2-3).

# Panel 3.1: How type is measured by typographers and vision scientists

Gordon Legge and Charles (Chuck) Bigelow explain the different way that
type is measured in the two disciplines: typographers describe the
physical size of type on the page or screen, commonly in points; vision
scientists combine the physical size and the viewing distance of the
reader, referred to as the angular size or visual angle (see below). 
The reason for this (apparently) more complicated measure is that
the image on our retina will be smaller if we are further away from the
type and the retinal image is what is most relevant (see [Chapter 2]({% link _chapters_en/2-how-we-read.md %}) for
details of the eye).

# Summary

Legibility research started with eye movement research over 100 years
ago. Some of these discoveries and writings are still valid today,
whilst others have been superseded as research has enabled more precise
measurements and a larger body of knowledge has developed.

Legibility straddles disciplines, broadly science and design, and in the
past, this has caused tension due to different objectives and, at times,
insensitive appraisal of other perspectives. As more collaborations are
developed, richer, more relevant, and more robust research findings
emerge to inform typographic practice.
