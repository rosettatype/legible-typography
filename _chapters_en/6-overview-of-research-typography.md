# Introduction

This chapter adopts the same approach as the previous chapter on type by 
including the context and objectives of the research.

# Letter spacing

In [Chapter 2]({% link _chapters_en/2-how-we-read.md %}) I introduced 'crowding' 
which refers to the effect of
surrounding letters in words on the ease of identifying letters. It is
easier to identify single letters if they are not in a word because the
adjacent letters can jumble the appearance of letters. This suggests
that increasing the space between letters would improve word
identification, due to making it easier to identify the individual
letters and accurately locate their position in relation to one another
(e.g. to avoid confusing casual and causal). But if too much space is
used, the letters may not be perceived as a group, i.e. a word. Another
possible disadvantage of increasing letter spacing is that upcoming
words, those we are about to read that are in our parafoveal vision,
will be even further away from our fixation and therefore our acuity
will be reduced.

A font has character widths (including space) built into it and most
text processing software will have some way of adjusting the letter
spacing from the default (0) value. Research exploring deviations from
the defaults has produced the consistent finding that tightening
(decreasing) letter spacing makes reading more difficult. However,
increasing spacing has resulted in contradictory results: either no
benefits or some benefit. This divergence can be explained by
differences in readers, typefaces, method of testing, and amount of
spacing.

Studies which use Courier, a monospaced typeface, found that tighter
than standard spacing reduced reading speed but increasing beyond the
standard did not increase reading speed ([Chung, 2002]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#chung-2002); 
[Yu, Cheung, Legge, and Chung, 2007]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#yu-cheung-legge-chung-2007)). There was no evidence that the effect of crowding was
reduced by increasing beyond the standard spacing. Using Courier is an
odd choice from a designer's perspective but it is easier to specify and
manipulate space with each letter occupying the same fixed width.
However, this property may be the reason why there is no advantage to
increasing letter spacing beyond standard. Monospacing (fixed width)
results in looser spacing, particularly for narrower letters, and
therefore might not need additional spacing, particularly as this means
that words will extend further into our peripheral vision ([Figure 6.1](#figure-6-1)).
The adjustments to letter spacing are also rather large compared with
later studies.

standard spacing appears quite loose.

More recent studies have included adult skilled readers, young readers
(7–8 and 9–10 year olds) and young readers with [developmental dyslexia]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#developmental-dyslexia). Words set in 14 point Times New
Roman with additional spacing (see [Figure 6.2](#figure-6-2)) are identified faster
than the default spacing. This is true for all three sets of readers.
However, when a reading task is used (not just single words) the
advantage for wider spacing is only found with dyslexic readers. The
reason why these different groups of readers were compared is because
crowding tends to be greater for younger readers compared to adults and
greater for dyslexics than normal readers ([Perea, Moret-Tatay, and Gómez, 2011]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#perea-moret-tatay-gomez-2011); 
[Perea, Panadero, Moret-Tatay, and Gómez, 2012]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#perea-panadero-moret-tatay-gomez-2012)).

**Figure 6.2:** Default spacing (top) and wider spacing (bottom), described
as increasing the value in Microsoft Word to 1.2

</figcaption>
</figure>

This relationship between increased crowding and spacing has been
further explored by measuring the extent of crowding in individuals and
looking at the corresponding effect of increasing letter, word, and line
spacing ([Joo, White, Strodtman, and Yeatman, 2018]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#joo-white-strodtman-yeatman-2018)). Normal spacing
consisted of words set in 11 point Calibri and spacing was increased by
using 11 point Fluent Calibri (see [Figure 6.3](#figure-6-3)). A sub-group of adults
with dyslexia who showed greater effects of crowding read faster with
the additional spacing. This study did not determine whether letter,
word, or line spacing is responsible for improving reading performance.

When 5–7 year old children were tested in a more natural reading
environment, changes in letter spacing from tight to very wide had no
effect on reading rate or errors ([Reynolds and Walker, 2004]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#reynolds-walker-2004)). The
children were asked to read aloud from a text set in 19 point Century
Educational typeface which is used by publishers of early readers
children's books.

With adult readers and more subtle changes in letter spacing (see [Figure 6.4](#figure-6-4)), 
responses get faster as spacing increases. Reading sentences, we
fixate for a shorter time if there is more spacing 
([Perea and Gómez, 2012a]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#perea-gomez-2012a), [2012b]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#perea-gomez-2012b)). 
However, when adults read in a more natural context
(reading stories for comprehension), there is no difference in overall
reading time between default spacing and expanded spacing (1.2), as in
[Figure 6.2](#figure-6-2) ([Perea, Giner, Marcet, and Gómez, 2016]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#perea-giner-marcet-gomez-2016)). 
Although fixations
are shorter with the extra space between letters, slightly more
fixations are made which cancels out the advantage. The saccade length
is similar in the default and expanded spacings. As we are used to
reading the default setting, and initiating saccades of a specific
length, the question remains as to whether we might adjust the number of
fixations if we read the expanded text for longer.

Research has confirmed that relatively small adjustments to letter
spacing will affect single word recognition in different ways depending
on whether the typeface is proportional or fixed width 
([Slattery, Yates, and Angele, 2016]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#slattery-yates-angele-2016)). When letter spacing is increased:

-   Words in proportional width typefaces (Calibri, Cambria, Georgia,
    and Verdana) are responded to faster.

-   Words in fixed width typefaces (Consolas and Courier New) are
    responded to slower. This confirms the earlier studies described
    above which also used Courier.

This study found no differences between serif and sans serif typefaces.
This may be because the default spacings are adjusted appropriately (see
[Figure 6.5](#figure-6-5)).

Slattery, Yates and Angele ([2016]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#slattery-yates-angele-2016)). 
The typefaces are (top to bottom) Calibri, Cambria, Georgia, Verdana, Consolas and Courier New.

</figure>

In summary, there is some evidence that slightly looser letter spacing
helps dyslexic readers and possibly other readers, but this will depend
on the typeface. E-books might therefore benefit from including control
over letter spacing, particularly for dyslexic readers. Adults spend
less time on individual fixations with looser spacing but more fixations
are made. It therefore looks as though the defaults determined by type
designers are appropriate even though they are not based on empirical
research.

# Word spacing 

In the studies above where sentences were read, word spacing increased
when letter spacing increased. Microsoft Word also automatically adjusts
spaces between words when the user changes letter spacing (see, for
example, [Figure 6.4](#figure-6-4)).

Word spaces allow us to segment text into words and help us target where
to land our eyes, based on parafoveal vision. The space before the first
letter of a word and space after the last letter also reduce crowding
effects. All of these factors argue for having quite large word spaces.
But there is a disadvantage as increasing word spaces pushes words
further into our peripheral vision where our acuity drops off sharply.
If letter spacing is reduced but word spacing increased, upcoming words
are not pushed further into peripheral vision (see [Figure 6.6](#figure-6-6)). One
study which used these spacings with Georgia and Consolas (a fixed width
sans serif) found a benefit from reducing letter spacing (a little) and
increasing word spacing. However, this was mainly with Georgia, rather
than Consolas, which can be explained by the default spacings (see
[Figure 6.5](#figure-6-5)). Georgia has tighter word spacing and so can benefit more
from an increase than Consolas 
([Slattery and Rayner, 2013]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#slattery-rayner-2013)).

<figure id="figure-6-6">
    <img src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/figure-6-6.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Relationship between letter and word spacing">
    <figcaption class="aside"><strong>Figure 6.6:</strong> The top sentence in each pair has the default letter and
word spacing. The bottom sentence in each pair has reduced letter
spacing and increased word spacing. The top pair uses the typeface
Georgia and the bottom pair is in Consolas.</figcaption>
</figure>

This relationship between word and letter spacing was explored further
by Slattery, Yates, and Angele ([2016]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#slattery-yates-angele-2016)) using Calibri and Consolas to
compare proportional and fixed width typefaces. They confirm the
importance of considering letter and word spacing together and propose
that spaces between words should be at least 3.5 times the spaces
between letters for efficient reading. As with letter spacing, fixed
width Consolas is read slower if word spacing is larger than default,
unless letter spacing is reduced. Calibri is read slower if word spacing
is reduced. Although this study involved reading sentences, the
researchers point out that only single lines of text were used and more
research is required using multiple lines.

In summary, when making adjustments to word spacing:

-   defaults built into different fonts and page layout software need to
    be taken into account

-   the relationship between letter and word spacing is important

-   characteristics of readers may be particularly relevant as younger
    readers and dyslexics are more susceptible to crowding effects

# Alignment

Paragraphs of text are typically aligned on the left with the right
margin either aligned to produce justified text or with a ragged right
margin to produce unjustified text. Most studies have shown no
differences in reading speed although fully justified text may be
problematic for poor readers when set in short lines, i.e. 7 words per
line, about 42 characters (see [Figure 6.7](#figure-6-7)) or even slightly longer,
about 52 characters ([Gregory and Poulton, 1970]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#gregory-poulton-1970); [Zachrisson, 1965]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#zachrisson-1965)). One
study has looked at alignment in web pages but using a search for a link
in a screen of text, rather than reading the text. Performance was
better with left-aligned then justified text although participants
preferred justified ([Ling and van Schaik, 2007]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#ling-van-schaik-2007)).

<figure id="figure-6-7" class="narrow">
    <img src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/figure-6-7.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Justified and unjustified text setting">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6.7:</strong> Short lines set in justified (top) and unjustified (bottom)
setting.</figcaption>
</figure>

The main reason proposed for the reduced legibility of justified text is
the uneven spacing, often described as 'rivers' of white. These larger
word spaces are more likely to occur with:

-   short lines

-   lots of long words

-   wider characters

-   no hyphenation

-   less sophisticated control over word (and letter) spacing

The assumption is that eye movements will be adversely affected by this
unevenness which might be due to the lack of rhythm. Another possible
explanation is that larger word spaces push forthcoming words further
into peripheral vision, reducing their acuity. These factors may be more
important for poorer readers who have a smaller [perceptual span]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#perceptual-span) (and who therefore make use of fewer letters to
the right). These proposed explanations have not been tested, as far as
I know. It is possible that the issue is not differences in legibility
but [aesthetic considerations.](#sn:aesthetic-considerations)

<aside id="sn:aesthetic-considerations" markdown="1">

Vertical rivers, where interword spaces line up with each other on successive lines, may not be a problem except aesthetically. Studies of eye movements suggest that we don’t use the text of the next line to preview what is coming next ([Pollatsek, Raney, Lagasse, and Rayner, 1993]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#pollatsek-raney-lagasse-rayner-1993)). I am not entirely certain who first used the term ‘rivers’ but it occurs in Dowding ([1966, p5]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#dowding-1966)), who also refers to aesthetic considerations, rather than legibility.

# Line length

Line length, sometimes described as line width, can be measured by:

-   physical length of the line (e.g. 15 centimetres), sometimes
    converted to visual angle by taking into account the viewing
    distance

-   number of characters per line (cpl) which can be varied by\
    1) changing type size, keeping physical length constant, or\
    2) keeping type size constant which varies physical length

    [Figure 6.8](#figure-6-8) shows the various ways of changing line lengths.

<figure id="figure-6-8" class="full">
    <img src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/figure-6-8.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Line length and type size">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6.8:</strong> Examples showing the relationship between physical line
length, number of characters per line, and type size. Top and middle:
same physical length but smaller type size in middle increases number of
characters per line. Top and bottom: same number of characters per line but physical length
varies because of type size.</figcaption>
</figure>

Research into the relative legibility of different line lengths in print
has led to recommendations that line lengths should not exceed about 70
cpl ([Spencer, 1968]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#spencer-1968)). Various studies summarised in Tinker ([1963]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#tinker-1963)) have
been interpreted as supporting an optimal line length of 52 cpl 
([Rayner and Pollatsek, 1989, p118]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#rayner-pollatsek-1989)). 
The explanation given for the legibility of
this moderate line length is that it is the outcome of a trade-off
between two opposing factors. If line lengths are too long, the return
sweeps to the beginning of the next line can be inaccurate. If the lines
are too short, readers cannot make maximum use of their peripheral
vision. However, [recent studies](https://designregression.com/article/line-length-revisited-following-the-research)
have questioned whether inaccurate return sweeps are necessarily
problematic.

Studies looking at line length on screen began in the 1980s but were
constrained as to how they could change line length. They did this by
changing the character density which meant characters of the same height
but different widths, looking something like [Figure 6.9](#figure-6-9).

<figure id="figure-6-9" class="full">
    <img src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/figure-6-9.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Different character densities">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6.9:</strong> A simulation of different character densities used in the
1980s to change type size and therefore number of characters per line.</figcaption>
</figure>

An early study showed that smaller characters, with more characters per
line (bottom of [Figure 6.9](#figure-6-9)) are read faster and more efficiently with
fewer fixations overall ([Kolers, Duchnicky, and Ferguson, 1981]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#kolers-duchnicky-ferguson-1981)). The
line lengths compared were 35 and 70 cpl. Around 20 years later, using
updated screen technology, line length was varied by changing the number
of characters of the same size ([Figure 6.10](#figure-6-10)). The study found that
reading rate tended to get faster as lines got longer, surprisingly even
up to 100 cpl ([Dyson, 2004]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#dyson-2004), 
[2005]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#dyson-2005)). Similar advantages for longer lines
on screen were found when searching for words, rather than continuous
reading ([Youngman and Scharff, 1998]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#youngman-scharff-1998); 
[Ling and van Schaik, 2006]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#ling-van-schaik-2006)).

<figure id="figure-6-10" class="full">
    <img src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/figure-6-10.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Different line lengths">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6.10:</strong> Three line lengths used by Dyson in various studies which
change the number of characters, keeping type size (and line spacing)
constant. The left is 25 cpl, the middle 55 cpl, and the right 100 cpl.</figcaption>
</figure>

However, a consistent finding is that long line lengths on screen are
least preferred or judged as least easy to read. Moderate line lengths
(around 50–70 cpl) are preferred which fits with preferences for line
lengths in print. This makes sense as readers may make similar
judgements regardless of whether they are reading print or from screen.
Readers may also be judging what they frequently encounter in printed
material as being easiest to read, i.e. familiarity determining
perceived legibility. But why might there be an advantage in reading
speed for long lines (up to around 100 characters) on screen whereas in
print, a maximum of 70 characters is most legible? Here are some
suggestions:

-   The subjective judgements might provide a hint. Long line lengths on
    screen look quite daunting and this may encourage faster less
    detailed reading, such as scanning or skimming. This is consistent
    with comprehension being poorer with long line lengths, compared
    with moderate length lines. In fact, Ling and van Schaik ([2006]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#ling-van-schaik-2006))
    suggest that longer line lengths should be used for quick scanning
    and shorter lines when text needs to be read more thoroughly.

-   The mechanics of reading texts on screen might also influence
    reading time. If required to scroll through texts, a longer line
    length will require less scrolling as there will be fewer lines. If
    we read whilst scrolling, we won't be slowed down by greater amounts
    of scrolling. If we don't, long line lengths will be more [efficient to navigate.](#sn:long-line-lengths)

-   A question remains as to why long lines might be less problematic in
    terms of the accuracy of the return sweep from the end of one line
    to the beginning of the next. As mentioned above, we tend to sit
    further away from a desktop computer screen than printed material
    which means that a line of text has a smaller visual angle. This
    smaller visual angle may make it easier to locate the correct
    position for our eyes when we do a return sweep. Another possible
    explanation is that the scrolling provides a cue to locating the
    next line, the upward movement of text reducing the difficulty with
    long lines. However, this is only likely to work if we scroll
    slowly, and may therefore be less relevant to touchscreen interfaces
    used on smartphones or tablets.

> Question: Are you convinced by any of the above suggestions? If you
encounter a long line length on the screen of a desktop computer, do you
adjust the settings? If so, why do you do this? Are you influenced by
what you read in print?
{: .question }

<aside id="sn:long-line-lengths">
The studies underpinning this discussion were carried out with desktop computers and scrolling using up and down cursor or arrow keys (see image). However, the formatting of text (line length and hence number of lines) is also relevant to scrolling through text on mobile devices.

</aside>

## Columns

Another means of varying line length is to set text in columns: multiple
columns generally result in shorter line lengths. There are a few
studies which have directly compared single and multiple columns in
print. The context for much of this research was exploring academic
printed journal designs which typically use multiple column formats. The
findings were not entirely consistent:

-   an advantage for narrow column setting ([Foster, 1970]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#foster-1970))

-   single columns read faster than double columns ([Poulton, 1959]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#poulton-1959))

-   no difference between a single column and double column ([Hartley, Burnhill, and Fraser, 1974]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#hartley-burnhill-fraser-1974))

-   with children aged around 11–12 years old there was slightly faster
    scanning for items in two columns (around 53 cpl) compared to one
    column (around 115 cpl). However, the longer line length was not
    problematic ([Hartley, Burnhill, and Davis, 1978]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#hartley-burnhill-davis-1978)).

In the early days of online versions of newspapers and magazines, column
formats were typically used on the web, often as PDFs, until these were
re-designed and tailored for screen viewing. In a comparison of one and
three columns on screen ([Figure 6.11](#figure-6-11)), the single column (80 cpl) was
read faster with no differences in comprehension ([Dyson and Kipping,
1997]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#dyson-kipping-1997)). This provides further support for the advantage of longer lines
[described above.](#sn:longer-lines)

<aside id="sn:longer-lines">
This study included two versions of the single column: one which used scrolling to move through the text and one which used a single keystroke to get to the next screenful of text (described as ‘paged’). The three-column format was presented only in a paged version as columns can only practically be read to the bottom of the screen. The single column using paging was the one read fastest.
</aside>

Some interesting additional findings from the Dyson and Kipping study
are:

-   The advantage for this single column was restricted to a younger age
    group (18–24 year olds). Those over 25 years old read each version
    at a similar speed. We surmised that the younger participants were
    more familiar with reading web pages (around 1997).

-   Comprehension was better for faster readers in the three-column
    version than for slower readers. We speculated that faster readers
    may use a different reading pattern and be able to scan narrow
    columns in an efficient manner to absorb information.

# Line spacing

A very early study indicated that increasing line space from no
additional space (same as point size) to 7 points additional space led
to faster reading; with more than 7 points, reading slowed down
([Bentley, 1921]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#bentley-1921)). As the type sizes used were 6, 9 and 12 point, this is
rather generous use of line space (see [Figure 6.12](#figure-6-12)).

additional line space. The bottom row has the same sizes with <span class="clarification" title="Illustration not to scale">7 points</span> additional space.

</figure>

As discussed in [Chapter 4]({% link _chapters_en/4-what-is-measured-and-how.md %}), 
designers do not make decisions on individual
typographic variables, but consider the relationship between these
variables. The legibility of a particular line length may be influenced
by the amount of line spacing. The problem of inaccurate return sweeps
when reading a long line may be alleviated by introducing more space
between the lines. Paterson and Tinker studied type size, line length
and line spacing of print by systematically varying all three
(summarised in [Tinker, 1965]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#tinker-1965)). 
The results were expressed as 'safety
zones' referring to limits of line length and line spacing within which
legibility would be satisfactory. These were generally between 1 and 4
points with not too much variation according to line length or type
size. What we may conclude from this is that line spacing should not be
too tight. Different typefaces are also perceived as needing different
amounts of line spacing to maximise their attractiveness or appeal for
reading with sans serif and italic needing one point more than serif
roman typefaces ([Becker, Heinrich, von Sichowsky, and Wendt, 1970]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#becker-heinrich-von-sichowsky-wendt-1970)).

Such extensive research has not been carried out for reading from
screen. Given the rather general outcomes, it is questionable as to
whether it would be worth repeating for screen. One study with the
objective of generating design guidelines for web pages compared Arial
10 point type set in single, 1.5 or double line spacing. The researchers
found that the greater the line space, the better able participants were
to locate hyperlinks within texts and their preferences also followed
this pattern ([Ling and van Schaik, 2007]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#ling-van-schaik-2007)).

Locating hyperlinks is an information retrieval task which will not
involve the same sequence of eye movements as continuous reading. It is
plausible that words are more easily identified when there is more space
above and below them. This seems to be confirmed by a study which looked
at line spacing from the perspective of crowding ([Chung, 2004]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#chung-2004)). Crowding
has been discussed above in terms of letter and word spacing, i.e.
horizontal space, whereas this study looked at vertical space which
designers call line spacing. The study looked at the speed of
identifying words and the results indicated that an increase in space
above and below words increased reading speed. If we look directly at
the word so that it falls onto the fovea, we benefit from increases of
about 1.25 to 1.5 the standard spacing (see [Figure 6.13](#figure-6-13)) and after that
there is no additional benefit. However, for words in peripheral vision
which we use to guide where we land our eyes following a saccade, even
greater line spacing is beneficial. These effects are greater for
smaller type sizes suggesting that line spacing should not be set at a
consistent percentage of type size; small sizes need relatively more
additional space. Although Tinker's method and approach were very
different, and the results expressed in a different way, there is some
agreement with the crowding conclusions.

**Figure 6.13:** Variations in space above and below words (line space) used

These studies indicate that optimal line spacing may be similar in print
and on screen. The benefits of generous spacing may be an aid to
improving the accuracy of return sweeps in longer lines, but also a
means of alleviating crowding from adjacent lines.

# Paragraph denotation

The typical ways of denoting paragraphs are:

-   space between paragraphs

-   indented first line

-   new line but no indent

-   occasionally, indented first line and space between paragraphs

The first three of these formats plus no denotation have been compared
with 11–12 year olds scanning a text for missing words 
([Hartley, Burnhill, and Davis, 1978]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#hartley-burnhill-davis-1978)). They found:

-   the version with space between paragraphs (1 in [Figure 6.14](#figure-6-14)) is
    scanned faster than the new line with no indent (3) and no
    denotation (4)

-   the version with additional space between paragraphs (1) is not
    scanned significantly faster than paragraphs denoted by an indent
    (2)

They conclude that as an indent uses less space, this is a more
cost-effective solution for print.

There does not appear to be any research which has pursued ways of
denoting paragraphs on screen. The cost is not a factor and typically
space is used to separate paragraphs (as in 1).

# Headings

Headings have the function of structuring a text, signalling the topic
covered in the following text, and providing an access point (i.e. to
locate a particular section). To serve these purposes, headings need to
be differentiated from surrounding text. Earlier in this chapter, bold
was considered as more appropriate than italic as a means of making
words stand out. Comparing all capitals and bold, newspaper headlines
were found to be located faster in bold lower case than all capitals
([Poulton, 1967]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#poulton-1967)). The lower case x-height was matched to the height of
capital letters as the typographic designer involved in this study
considered these to be optimal for the setting (see [Figure 5.19]({% link _chapters_en/5-overview-of-research-type.md %}#figure-5-19)). The
capitals were set at the size that were in current use in the newspaper.
This approach was in keeping with the practical purpose of the research
which was carried out at the request of the editor of *The Times*
newspaper.

Research comparing different graphic treatments of headings is however
very limited and there has been more emphasis on the linguistic function
of headings in facilitating processing of text and improving recall
(e.g. [Hyönä and Lorch, 2004]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#hyona-lorch-2004)). We do know that the position of headings
(embedded or in the margin) did not matter for 14–15 year olds 
([Hartley and Trueman, 1983]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#hartley-trueman-1983)). ([Figure 6.15](#figure-6-15)) We might therefore conclude that the
two solutions are similar in terms of usability.

</figcaption>
</figure>

One study took a different approach to identifying the most appropriate
typography for headings in text by exploring how easy it is to visually
discriminate among them using a set of cards 
([Williams and Spyridakis, 1992]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#williams-spyridakis-1992)). They measured the time required to place 16 different heading
treatments in order of importance. The assumption is that if we can do
this quickly, this suggests that the headings are clearly different from
each other and consequently, they would work in a text to indicate the
hierarchical structure. The treatments used type size, position
(centred, flush left, indented, embedded), underlining, and case. Type
size was perceived as the most powerful cue to the hierarchical status
of the heading, which is understandable as there is little ambiguity in
this treatment: a larger heading means a higher level of heading. A more
subtle finding is that their participants found it easier to make
judgements when the headings varied along fewer dimensions (e.g. size
alone versus size and position).

Some care should be taken in applying these results to practice as
headings need to be differentiated from body text as well as from [other
headings.](#sn:other-headings) It may therefore
be desirable to change at least two dimensions to identify headings
(e.g. size, case, typeface or type variant) and indicate the hierarchy
of headings through one change, possibly size. There may be an
interesting difference in which variable is used in different countries.
In Mexico, upper case is frequently used for headings.

<aside id="sn:other-headings" markdown="1">

Williams and Spyridakis ([1992]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#williams-spyridakis-1992)) are aware of the difference between

- determining whether headings are the same or different, where variation on more dimensions will look more dissimilar

- how headings relate to each other and interpreting whether size is more important than position, case or underlining

But their test material may have lost sight of normal practice, which would not use 16 levels of heading and headings as large as 57 points.
</aside>

The space above and below headings appears not to have been specifically
investigated in an empirical study but the Gestalt laws of grouping and
organisation can inform practice ([Panel 6.1](#panel-6-1)). The Gestalt law of
proximity states that elements positioned closer together are seen as a
group and perceived to be more closely related than other elements in
the image or display. Headings need to be seen to relate to the text
below, rather than float between paragraphs or appear to group with the
text above. To enable this grouping, there needs to be more space above
a heading than below ([Figure 6.16](#figure-6-16)).

heading is closer to the text above and therefore does not appear to be
part of the following paragraph.</figcaption>

# Panel 6.1: Description of Gestalt psychology

Gestalt psychology stems from a German philosophy of the mind and is
associated with Wertheimer ([1923]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#wertheimer-1923)), 
Koffka ([1935]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#koffka-1935)) and 
Köhler ([1947]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#kohler-1947)). You
may have heard the famous phrase 'The whole is *greater* than the sum of
the parts'. This happens to be a mistranslation and should be 'The whole
is *other* than the sum of the parts'. What is meant is that the Gestalt
(shape or form or configuration) that we perceive is different from the
separate parts. This maxim should resonate with designers as we know
that typographic variables interact and need to be considered in
relation to one another.

Other than the law of proximity, there are laws of good continuation,
common fate, similarity, and Prägnanz or simplicity. The law of
simplicity says that we will perceive ambiguous or complex images as the
simplest form possible. This law is a good example of why Gestalt
psychology has been criticised by vision researchers. What is meant by a
simple form? This is a vague qualitative description that seems to evade
measurement. How do we measure what is simplest? One way is described in
[Panel 5.3]({% link _chapters_en/5-overview-of-research-type.md %}#panel-5-3). There are now some quantitative approaches to Gestalt
perception but as yet, the studies' results are diverse and
heterogeneous with little theoretical coherence 
([Jäkel, Singh, Wichmann, and Herzog, 2016]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#jakel-singh-wichmann-herzog-2016)). 
We are therefore left with an intuitively appealing
demonstration ([Figure 6.16](#figure-6-16)) that space can be used in typography to
support processing of text without any supporting evidence. The
demonstration works because we are encouraged to perceive a specific
grouping and it makes sense to do so — the demonstration is convincing.

# Overall layout

Some studies have taken a global approach by looking at layouts which
vary a number of different features, acknowledging the importance of the
relationship between typographic variables. Two approaches have been
used:

-   identifying dimensions, [constructs]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#construct) or variables used
    to make judgements

-   measuring the effects of 'good' and 'poor' layouts

## Identifying dimensions, constructs or variables

A study ([Grabinger, 1993]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#grabinger-1993)) 
aiming to identify constructs which would
inform the design of screens used a notation system
([Twyman, 1981]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#twyman-1981)) to present 
examples to participants ([Figure 6.17](#figure-6-17)). An `x` denotes the 
typographic norm and `o` a variation from the norm. The
typographic variables tested included various combinations of line
length, number of columns, line spacing, and paragraph denotation.
Participants judged the readability and studyability of the screens
using paired comparisons (see [Chapter 4: Paired comparisons]({% link _chapters_en/4-what-is-measured-and-how.md %}#comparing-typefaces)). 
The results indicated that the
organisation of screens and their visual interest were relevant to
judgements and single spacing and two columns resulted in more positive
judgements. Because a number of variables differed across screens, the
individual contribution of line spacing and number of columns cannot be
identified.

## Effects of good and poor layout

A number of studies have tested different versions of documents that are
assumed to differ in legibility, based on previous research and
guidelines. Two such studies comparing screen formats found no
differences in performance measures but preference for an 'enhanced'
format ([Muter and Maurutto, 1991]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#muter-maurutto-1991)) 
or a 'well-structured' text layout 
([de Bruijn, de Mul, and van Oostendorp, 1992]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#de-bruijn-de-mul-van-oostendorp-1992)). 
A later study ([Chaparro, Shaikh, and Baker, 2005]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#chaparro-shaikh-baker-2005)) 
also looking at screens resulted in the same
outcome: no difference in reading speed or comprehension but an enhanced
layout was preferred, regarded as less tiring to read, and satisfaction
scores were higher.

One recent study from an undergraduate dissertation at the University of
Reading, UK ([Moys, Loveland, and Dyson, 2018]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#moys-loveland-dyson-2018)) 
did find performance
differences between layouts varying in typographic quality. The 'good'
layout was read faster and there were differences in the accuracy of
recall. The results of this study are intriguing because the differences
in recall depend on whether the participants read print or eInk
(Kindle). The screen (eInk) version is as we would expect: more correct
answers when the layout is better. But the print version reverses this
result: recall is better with a poor layout. There is a possible
explanation as to why a poor layout improves performance (introduced in
[Chapter 7]({% link _chapters_en/7-beyond-legibility-research.md %})) 
but it is difficult to explain why the results are different
for eInk and print.

> Question: Do you have any suggestions as to why the results are
different?
{: .question }

Setting aside the lack of explanation for the outcomes, the study by
Moys, Loveland, and Dyson ([2018]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#moys-loveland-dyson-2018)) 
found differences in both reading speed
and recall, unlike the earlier studies. What might explain this
divergence? The studies vary in many ways but the most obvious reason is
likely to be the design of the test material. Unlike most of the
research summarised earlier in this chapter which focuses on one
typographic variable, these formats or layouts require the researchers
to produce well-designed material as well as the, arguably, easier task
of producing poorly designed material. Design guidelines need to be
interpreted and decisions made as to how to combine variables. As
discussed in [Chapter 4]({% link _chapters_en/4-what-is-measured-and-how.md %}), if the researchers lack design training, this is
not an easy task.

The studies conducted in the 1990s did not illustrate their test
material, which we know is fairly typical. Consequently, it is difficult
to state with any certainty that the materials used were not appropriate
exemplars of good and bad layouts. However, Muter and Maurutto ([1991]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#muter-maurutto-1991))
suggest that some of their 'enhancements' may have had a negative
effect, for example indenting every other line (see [Figure 6.18](#figure-6-18),
bottom). This lack of a consistent left margin would probably create
problems with return sweeps of the eyes.

</figure>

The later study ([Chaparro, Shaikh, and Baker, 2005]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#chaparro-shaikh-baker-2005)) does include
examples of 'enhanced' and 'poor' layouts which were created by 'expert
typographers'. An indication of the layouts is given in [Figure 6.19](#figure-6-19). The
most evident aspect of poor practice is the splitting of text around an
image. In this case, the measures of performance may not have been
sufficiently sensitive to detect differences. For example, participants
were able to go back to the passages to look up the answers to
comprehension questions, with some time constraint. This is much easier
than needing to recall what has been read.

</figure>

The test material used in Moys, Loveland, and Dyson ([2018]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#moys-loveland-dyson-2018)) was also
designed by someone with typographic training (the student author,
Loveland) and varied alignment, character spacing, line spacing, and
line length. The exact same typographic treatments were not implemented
for print and eInk. This would have caused both to have sub-optimal
typography, when the aim was good typography, and so would have been an
unnecessary compromise. Suitable typography for each was therefore used.
Poor typography used justified text (to introduce inconsistencies in
word spacing) tighter letter spacing, greater line spacing, and a
substantially longer line length (see [Figure 6.20](#figure-6-20)). The optimisation of
the layouts for the good examples, and manipulation of many typographic
attributes in creating the poor layout, may account for the differences
in performance. Also, a delay was introduced between reading the text
and answering multiple choice questions (without referring back to the
texts) which may have increased the sensitivity of this measure.

Despite the positive reasons for including multiple variables together
in one study, most of the outcomes have rather limited value in
informing us of how to design to optimise legibility. They do indicate
that participants (readers) can judge which layouts are better, or
rather their judgements agree with the researchers' judgements.

which layouts are more legible and their judgements agreeing with
researchers'. Why might this distinction be important?

# Summary

The overviews in chapter 5 and 6 are not exhaustive as there are factors which affect
legibility, such as contrast of type to background, reversed out type,
and size of margins, which have not been covered. I do not have a clear
rationale for excluding these, other than to suggest that the research
is rather limited and seems less relevant to current practice.

You will probably also have noticed that there are varying amounts of
research depending on the typographic attribute or variable. I would not
say that I have covered every research study but this unevenness
probably does mirror, to a reasonable extent, the relative volume of
work in each area. We might, therefore, ask why isn't there much work on
paragraph denotation? I can speculate that because the research that
exists does not show any differences, it is of less interest to other
researchers. Unlike some areas of research which can inform models and
theories of reading or overlap with other disciplines, the treatment of
paragraphs has direct application to design practice but little
theoretical significance. It is therefore falls to applied researchers
to pursue this topic. In other areas, valuable insights emerge from
combining results from different types of researchers with different
objectives.

Along with the uneven coverage, there are discrepancies in the
reliability and informativeness of the research. This is particularly
the case where little research exists or there are contradictory
results. In such cases, you may be left to make up your own mind about
what to take away from the overview, but I hope I have provided some
guidance.

In researching for this text, I was excited to discover a very large
number of studies published by a Spanish Professor of Psychology at the
University of Valencia: Manuel Perea. You will have seen his name cited
quite a few times in the overviews. This research encouraged me as the
majority of legibility studies have been carried out in English and with
participants who are familiar with typographic conventions in the UK or
US. In a couple of places in this text, I have mentioned conventions
that may differ in Mexico (thanks to my editor). Although the studies by
Perea are done in Spain, they are extending the generality of the
results to the Spanish language and Perea is keen to consider any
possible influence of the language on the results (though not the
typographic conventions).

Along with his fellow researchers, Perea has recognised the potential
importance of typographic factors in reading and explored:

-   upper versus lower case

-   interletter spacing

-   upper versus lower halves of letters

-   bold type

-   serif versus sans serif

I am therefore hopeful that this recent interest from various groups of
researchers encourages others to delve further into the effects of
typography on reading to inform practitioners.
