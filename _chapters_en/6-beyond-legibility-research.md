description: extends discussion of legibility from conventional topics to more recent themes

# Broadening the scope

This book started with a broad definition of legibility and deliberately
avoided constraining the definition to the clarity of individual
characters. Taking this approach has given me the freedom to write about
typographic variables which may impact on legibility, readability,
usability (or other related concepts). Nevertheless, the content of this
book does reflect a rather traditional approach to legibility, i.e.
studies from over 50 years ago, with some updating to include recent
studies. There are also screen-based studies from over 30 years ago.

You may question the relevance of such old research to designing for
print or screen today — I certainly do. My reasons to include older
material are because the studies:

-   provide a means of comparison with more recent research, as some
    results may still be valid

-   create a framework for introducing newer studies, by identifying
    variables and methods

-   fill gaps as there isn't yet a large body of research on the
    legibility of newer technologies such as mobile devices

I find a comparison of print and screen legibility of particular
personal interest as my own research was underpinned by a belief that we
shouldn't simply apply what we know about designing for print to screen
design. My view is that research on print legibility can both inform and
constrain screen design. General principles such as consistency, ease of
navigation, good legibility will apply to print and screen-based
technologies. However, the particularities of the screen, how we
interact with it, for what purposes (i.e. skimming, scanning, continuous
reading), and our familiarity and comfort with its use will impact on
legibility.

In this last chapter, I will explore:,

-   how familiarity might contribute to legibility

-   interacting with mobile devices

-   impressions of typographic material

-   a challenge to legibility

# Familiarity revisited

As indicated in [Chapter 4]({% link _chapters_en/4-what-is-measured-and-how.md %}), typeface familiarity has been addressed
directly by Beier and Larson ([2013]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#beier-larson-2013)). They considered two perspectives
proposing that familiarity is based on:

-   amount of exposure to the typeface; this coincides with Licko's
    definition of legibility described in [Panel 1.1]({% link _chapters_en/1-what-do-we-mean-by-legibility.md %}#panel-1-1): 'You read best what you read most'

-   common letter shapes resulting in a prototype or skeleton for each
    letter; this can be identified by superimposing common typefaces to
    reveal the parts that are shared by the typefaces (see [Figure 6.1](#figure-6-1))

<figure id="figure-6-1" class="side-by-side">
    <img src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/FIG-6-1.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Superimposed letter a">
    <figcaption markdown="1">
    
**Figure 6.1:** Based on Frutiger ([1998, p202]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#frutiger-1998)) who superimposed the letter `a` in eight typefaces to demonstrate the skeleton form (darkest
area). Here the typefaces are Times, Palatino, Baskerville, Garamond,
Helvetica, Univers, Bodoni, and Minion.

</figcaption>
</figure>

The study aims to establish which of the two perspectives on familiarity
affects reading speed and preferences. Fonts were designed with:

-   common letter shapes, matching the skeletons

-   uncommon letter shapes, different from the skeletons

Fonts were selected which are:

-   known to participants (through previous exposure)

-   unknown (i.e. new) to participants as they were designed for the
    study by Sofie Beier

The fonts used in the study are listed in [Table 6.1](#table-6-1). There is a blank
cell in the table (uncommon letter shapes that are known fonts) because
we don't usually encounter fonts with uncommon letter shapes. You will
see examples of the uncommon letters shapes in Spencer Neue and PykeText
Neue in the bottom, right cell.

<aside class="table" id="table-6-1" markdown="1">

</figure>
</aside>

The study involves two short reading speed tests, separated by a longer
(20 minute) session where short stories are read in the typeface being
tested. Participants also answer questions about the reading experience
after each reading speed test. More detail of the method is provided in
[Box 6.1](#box-6-1).

The results do not give us a clear indication as to how familiarity
might contribute to legibility. There is still some ambiguity as to
whether the amount of exposure to a typeface is critical to legibility
or common letter shapes. With all fonts, participants read more
paragraphs in the post-test compared to the pre-test, meaning they read
faster in the second test. This might be interpreted as support for the
exposure explanation as the post-test came after reading more in the
font. However, this could also be a [practice effect]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#practice-effect)
as we are likely to be better at a task the second time we carry it out.
The fonts with uncommon letter shapes (Spencer Neue and PykeTest Neue)
were read as fast as the ones with common letter shapes (known and
unknown).

The responses to questions did reveal that the uncommon letter shapes
are not considered enjoyable for reading in the future, nor a
comfortable reading experience, and cause participants to focus on the
typeface. Although these negative perceptions are less strong after more
exposure, they contrast with the positive responses to common letter
shapes. These judgements therefore support the explanation that we
desire the familiarity of letters which are close to the prototype or
skeleton.

If we are guided by readers' opinions, we will be conservative in our
letterform design in case readers choose not to read typefaces which
vary too much from those they have read before, even though they can be
read efficiently. This disparity between subjective judgements of what
is easy to read or preferred and how easily we actually read text occurs
with line lengths on screen (see [Chapter 5]({% link _chapters_en/5-overview-of-research.md %})). If we are conditioned to
perceive what we meet most often as easiest to read (common letter
shapes or moderate line lengths) then repeated exposure to the less
familiar may reduce the mismatch between our judgements and our
performance. However, reader's experiences with the less familiar need
to be perceived in a more positive manner — a challenge for designers.

> Question: If what people say they read best is not what they actually
read best, which result would you use to inform your design? Can you
think of any ways in which less familiar typographic treatments might be
introduced?

# Box 6.1: Details of familiarity study method

Each participant repeats the procedure three times with different
typefaces (one from each of the cells in [Table 6.1](#table-6-1)). The procedure
consists of:

-   **Reading speed pre-test** which uses a version of the Tinker Speed
    of Reading test (described in [Chapter 4]({% link _chapters_en/4-what-is-measured-and-how.md %})). This involves reading a
    number of short paragraphs and identifying the word which spoils the
    meaning in each paragraph. The time is limited to 2 minutes.

-   **Pre-test questionnaire** where participants are asked to rate
    their level of agreement with a series of statements on a 7-point
    scale from +3 (I strongly agree) to -3 (I strongly disagree). The
    statements are:

    *I will enjoy reading this typeface in the future*

    *I was constantly focusing on the typeface*

    *I still remember most of what I was reading*

    *This was a comfortable reading experience*

    *I have encountered this typeface before*

-   **Exposure session** where participants read short stories in the
    typeface from the pre-test

-   **Reading speed post-test** which is identical to the pre-test
    except different short paragraphs are read

-   **Post-test questionnaire** where participants again rate their
    agreement on a 7-point scale to four of the five questions asked in
    the pre-test and a new one:

    *I will enjoy reading this typeface in the future*

    *I was constantly focusing on the typeface*

    *I still remember most of what I was reading*

    *This was a comfortable reading experience*

    *I find the typeface easier to read now than I did at the beginning
    of the test*

# Brief glances at text 

The type of reading we engage in, and our use of mobile devices, has
been addressed by a Clear Information Presentation Consortium which
started with MIT ([Massachusetts Institute of
Technology](http://web.mit.edu/)) AgeLab collaborating with Monotype
(font and technology specialists). They concern themselves with mobile
computing and an initial study ([Reimer, Mehler, Dobres, Coughlin, Metteson, Gould, Chahine and Levantovsky, 2014]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#reimer-mehler-dobres-coughlin-matteson-gould-et-al-2014)) used a driving
simulator. They compare menu selection with two typefaces that are
typical of those used in the car industry for vehicle displays:
Eurostile and Frutiger (see [Figure 6.2](#figure-6-2)). A distinction is made between
reading continuous text and the brief glances typical of reading
displays when driving. Their study indicated that men look less often
and spend less time glancing at menu text displays set in Frutiger
compared to Eurostile. Women did not show this difference between the
two typefaces. To explain this gender difference, the researchers
speculate that there may be perceptual differences associated with
gender or that women are more risk averse. The latter seems more
probable as women tended to spend less time looking at the displays and
therefore longer looking at the road (in the simulation).

> Question: What is your interpretation of this gender difference?
{: .question }

([2016]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#dobres-chahine-reimer-gould-mehler-coughlin-2016)).

</figcaption>
</figure>

A subsequent study by the same group abandoned the driving simulator and
used a short exposure method (see [Chapter 4]({% link _chapters_en/4-what-is-measured-and-how.md %}) and [Panel 4.3]({% link _chapters_en/4-what-is-measured-and-how.md %}#panel-4-3)), adapting the
display time for each participant and using a [lexical decision task]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#lexical-decision-task) 
([Dobres, Chahine, Reimer, Gould, Mehler, and Coughlin, 2016]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#dobres-chahine-reimer-gould-mehler-coughlin-2016)). They found that Frutiger is more legible than
[Eurostile.](#sn:frutiger-eurostile) Men and women
show the same pattern of results when the effects of driving behaviour
are removed. The previous results could therefore be explained by a
difference in women's approach to a task involving driving and not the
unlikely explanation of perceptual differences. (See [Panel 6.1](#panel-6-1) for
comment on the change in method).

# Panel 6.1: Comment on a change in method

The switch from a driving simulator to less natural reading conditions
(a method used by vision and reading researchers) is noteworthy as this
reverses the usual concern of designers for ecological or face validity.
The researchers acknowledge that the driving simulator setup has better
face validity but also requires more resources, making a large number of
studies impractical. Their use of a short exposure method indicates an
acceptance of a method based on speed of reading for legibility
research. This runs counter to a common perspective of designers that
faster reading is not necessarily of primary concern to them. However,
given the context of this research (interface design within vehicles),
speed of reading becomes a valid measure of legibility.

# Navigation through different menu styles

[Chapter 1]({% link _chapters_en/1-what-do-we-mean-by-legibility.md %}) mentioned usability as a way of describing the ease of *using*
print or screen material, whereas legibility involves reading. Usability
therefore encompasses navigation and although the term was used in
[Chapter 5]({% link _chapters_en/5-overview-of-research.md %}) to describe the use of headings in printed text, usability
commonly refers to interacting with screen-based technologies.

A study which uses smartphones to compare different styles of menu
design provides an example of a usability study with technology current
in 2014. The study uses a 3.5 inch (8.89 cm, diagonal measurement)
iPhone 4S, running iOS 7.1. This research was carried out for an
undergraduate dissertation at the University of Reading, UK
([Rudgard-Redsell, 2014]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#rudgard-redsell-2014)). As the small screens of smartphones have fewer
pixels available to display content and navigation tools, various
different styles of menus have been built into operating systems. The
study compared the four menu styles shown in [Figure 6.3](#figure-6-3) and measured
usability through the time taken to complete a task requiring navigation
to various screens. This performance measure was compared with their
subjective judgements of usability including:

-   perceived ease of use

-   perceived speed of use

-   preference for use

-   most often seen

-   aesthetic qualities

-   preferred style overall

The study described in [Chapter 5, Box 5.2]({% link _chapters_en/5-overview-of-research.md %}#box-5-2) compares actual and perceived
legibility (how we read compared with our judgements). Here we are
looking at a similar comparison of actual and perceived usability.

<figure id="figure-6-3">
    <img src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/FIG-6-3.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Four menu styles">
    <figcaption class="aside" markdown="1">
    
**Figure 6.3:** Four menu styles tested, from left to right: drop down, tab
bar, side menu, grid view ([Rudgard-Redsell, 2014]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#rudgard-redsell-2014)).

</figcaption>
</figure>

The study found that the tab bar menu style is navigated fastest and
also perceived as the fastest to use. However, the side menu is thought
to be easier to use and more aesthetically pleasing. This suggests that
the users placed greater emphasis on how much content can be shown on
the small screen, rather than speed of navigation. With the side bar,
when the menu is inactive, the menu only takes up the space of one
button to show and hide menu options. The tab bar has menu options
constantly visible on screen taking up more space.

The participants in the study were young undergraduate students at the
University of Reading, and most regularly used social media apps. The
author acknowledges that the results may have been different with less
experienced users, but the results inform us that users don't
necessarily prefer the fastest method of navigation. Instead, they like
a style they are comfortable with and consider aesthetically pleasing.
Developing software that matches these preferences is an important
aspect of user interface design and underlines the relationship between
functionality (usability or legibility) and aesthetics (see [Chapter 1]({% link _chapters_en/1-what-do-we-mean-by-legibility.md %})).

> Question: If you were designing an interface, what would you prioritise?
{: .question }

# Aesthetics

Some recent work complements legibility research by allowing both
functional and aesthetic dimensions or constructs to emerge from
readers' perceptions of documents. The research extends the studies of
typeface semantics (described in [Chapter 5]({% link _chapters_en/5-overview-of-research.md %})) to look at the connotations
of different typographic layouts. These incorporate stylistic variables
(e.g. typeface and weight) and spatial or structural attributes (e.g.
columns and use of white space) ([Moys 2014a]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#moys-2014a), [2014b]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#moys-2014b)). The approach taken
reflects the multivariate nature of document design: considering the
interplay among typographic variables. It also allows participants to
comment on constructs which are relevant to them, rather than imposed by
the [researcher.](#sn:researcher)

<aside id="sn:researcher" markdown="1">

The technique used in Moys ([2014a]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#moys-2014a)) uses a repertory grid procedure which elicits [constructs]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#construct) from participants, rather than providing these. It is based on Kelly’s personal construct theory of personality ([Kelly, 1955]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#kelly-1955)) and has been developed and applied to different disciplines, such as the study by Bartram ([1982]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#bartram-1982)) on typeface semantics summarised earlier in [Chapter 5]({% link _chapters_en/5-overview-of-research.md %}). 

</aside>

Based on a preliminary study, magazine layouts with three patterns of
typographic differentiation (high, moderate, low) and controlled content
were used to investigate participants' impressions of documents. 
[Figure 6.4](#figure-6-4) illustrates examples of the three typographic differentiation
patterns. The key themes that emerge are:

-   references to the appearance of the documents (i.e. stylistic and
    structural attributes)

-   evaluative comments that refer to the appeal to particular readers

-   references to the kinds of content, publications, genres, etc.

-   appraisals of credibility or appropriateness

-   consideration of how readers experience and interact with documents,
    relating to usability and reading

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6.4:</strong> Three examples of magazine layouts designed to show
different levels of typographic differentiation: a) has high
differentiation, b) has moderate and c) has low.</figcaption>
</figure>

The final theme relates to legibility and demonstrates that readers are
sensitive to the way in which typographic layouts may hinder or support
reading ([Moys, 2014a]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#moys-2014a)). However, there is a broad range of impressions
which enables us to consider how legibility or usability sits alongside
evaluations of aesthetics, genre, and suitability for specific purposes.
As indicated in [Chapter 1]({% link _chapters_en/1-what-do-we-mean-by-legibility.md %}), legibility should not focus solely on the
physical characteristics of the text. Legibility is also determined by
the purpose and context for reading and the characteristics of the
reader. Participants perceive these many aspects relating to the
typography of documents when able to use their own
[constructs]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#construct).

# The case against legibility | disfluency
{: #the-case-against-legibility-disfluency}

In the last section of [Chapter 5]({% link _chapters_en/5-overview-of-research.md %}#overall-layout), I describe a study where a poor layout
improves recall of content compared with a good layout when reading
print, but not with an eInk device. The print result therefore
contradicts the findings of legibility research whereas reading from an
eInk device confirms the findings.

I already have one unanswered question: why are the results different
for print and eInk? A second question is why does a layout, which past
research tells us is more difficult to read, help with recall. We should
remember that the poor layout in both print and eInk did slow down
reading, which fits with the results of legibility research.

A possible answer to the second question comes from some research which
has looked at how the font used to present material can affect the
fluency of processing the information ([Song and Schwarz, 2010]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#song-schwarz-2010)). One of
their studies compared a description of an exercise routine in Arial
with the same description in Brush (see [Figure 6.5](#figure-6-5)). Readers thought the
exercise would take nearly twice as long when read in the more
difficult-to-read font ([Song and Schwarz, 2008]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#song-schwarz-2008)). They misinterpreted the
difficulty in reading as a difficulty in doing the exercise.

<figure id="figure-6-5">

Schwarz ([2010]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#song-schwarz-2010)).

</figcaption>
</figure>

Another later study found that fonts which are harder to read improve
learning ([Diemand-Yauman, Oppenheimer, and Vaughan, 2011]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#diemand-yauman-oppenheimer-vaughan-2011)). The
explanation is based on the concept of [disfluency]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#disfluency) which
refers to our [metacognitive experience]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#metacognitive-experience) of
ease or difficulty. In the context of learning, it is an awareness of
the difficulty of reading less legible fonts and this is supposed to
make us put more effort into the task. By putting in more effort, we
process the text more thoroughly and therefore remember more. These
researchers demonstrated the benefit of hard-to-read fonts in a memory
task and in the real-life context of a classroom.

There are various problems with research on disfluency which are
explored fully in [Box 6.2](#box-6-2). Whilst it is tempting to ignore this work, I
think it is important to include here because:

-   one of my students found this curious result ([Moys, Loveland, and Dyson, 2018]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#moys-loveland-dyson-2018))

-   the studies by Diemand-Yauman *et al*. ([2011]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#diemand-yauman-oppenheimer-vaughan-2011)) receive a lot of
    attention: [541 citations](#sn:diemand-yauman-citations) and [articles in popular press](#sn:popular-press)

-   studies which explore disfluency by using hard-to-read fonts, or
    other typographical variations, do not refer to legibility research;
    I think it is helpful to bring together these two fields of study

<aside id="sn:diemand-yauman-citations">

</aside>

Perhaps because of the far-reaching implications of promoting
disfluency, there have been various studies checking whether they can
[replicate]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#replicate) the results. A lot of these studies have failed
to find that making material harder to read improves recall or
comprehension. This indicates that disfluency effects are not robust
(repeatable) and efforts have been made to work out which
characteristics might affect the results. Suggestions include:

-   learner characteristics (e.g. academic abilities, spatial abilities,
    prior knowledge, motivation)

-   task characteristics (e.g. task difficulty, self-paced versus paced
    reading)

-   material characteristics (e.g. how different is the hard-to-read
    version)

Despite these investigations, we don't yet know the disfluent conditions
which might help us remember what we have read. A fairly consistent
result from these studies is that we are slower to read material that
has been deliberately made harder to read. This is hardly a surprise and
is essentially the same as the results of legibility research. I
wouldn't recommend using less legible material in your design practice
as we don't have good evidence that there is an improvement in retention
or recall. Although disfluency may sometimes have positive benefits,
communicators and educators are advised to present information in a form
that facilitates easy processing, promoting legibility ([Song and Schwarz, 2010, p111]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#song-schwarz-2010)). 
Even Diemand-Yauman and colleagues warned us that
there is a danger of moving from disfluent material to illegible
material where it would hinder learning ([Diemand-Yauman *et al*., 2011,
p114]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#diemand-yauman-oppenheimer-vaughan-2011)).

Returning to the first question in [Chapter 1]({% link _chapters_en/1-what-do-we-mean-by-legibility.md %}), how would you answer this
now?

> Question: Is legibility a binary concept (i.e. legible or illegible) or
are there degrees of legibility, and perhaps also illegibility? If there
are degrees, how do we decide what is an acceptable level of legibility?

# Box 6.2: Details of studies looking further into disfluency

A whole issue of a journal (*Metacognition and Learning*) is devoted to
gathering evidence to support or refute the disfluency argument to
determine whether this practice should be recommended for instructional
material. A reason to compile a special issue is that studies which do
not show any effects tend not to be published. This could mean that
there have been a lot of attempts to [replicate]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#replicate)
Diemand-Yauman *et al.*'s study and these have been unsuccessful. The
results published in *Metacognition and Learning* are clear: the studies
testing the effect of disfluency failed to show better performance due
to disfluency. Some of the detail covers failed attempts to find the
same results and a few hints as to what might affect the outcomes of
such studies. I have included quite a lot of detail because of the
attention given to disfluency.

-   *A possible [confound]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#confounding-variable) with distinctiveness*<br>
    Designers and psychologists have noticed that there may be a
    confound in these original studies. Disfluent materials are
    typically also unusual and might therefore be distinctive. Rummer,
    Schweppe, and Schwede ([2016]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#rummer-schweppe-schwede-2016)) explored whether the effects on
    learning of hard-to-read fonts may come from distinctiveness which
    attracts attention and results in better learning. They found no
    evidence for this and question the generality of disfluency effects.

-   *Differences between screen and print*<br>
    Although looking at mathematics problems rather than reading
    continuous texts, a study by Sidi, Ophir, and Ackerman ([2016]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#sidi-ophir-ackerman-2016)) is
    relevant to the results of the study by Moys, Loveland, and
    Dyson ([2018]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#moys-loveland-dyson-2018)) described in [Chapter 5]({% link _chapters_en/5-overview-of-research.md %}) which found a difference between
    screen and print for good and poor layouts. In both studies, there
    are no differences in performance between screen and print. But Sidi
    *et al*. found a difference between problems set in Arial 18 point
    black and those in Arial 9 point, italic, light grey ([Figure 6.6](#figure-6-6)).
    On screen, the maths problems set in the less legible font result in
    a better success rate. On paper, they find the reverse: a higher
    success rate in solving the problems when the font is legible. The
    two studies therefore both have results in different directions for
    screen and paper but with the maths problems, the results for paper
    are in line with what we would predict from legibility research. In
    Moys *et al*.'s study, the eInk results are predictable from
    legibility research. Therefore, although this new study does not
    explain what is [mediating]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#mediating) these results, it does
    indicate that characteristics of the material (e.g. the medium) can
    influence the results and in rather complicated ways.

-   *Measurement of eye movements*<br>
    Eye movements fail to show overall differences between clear
    material and blurred material. Reading times were shorter for less
    clear material on the first two screens but then longer on the last
    two. Readers may therefore be adjusting their reading strategy as
    they get used to the blurred (disfluent) material 
    ([Strukelj, Scheiter, Nystrom, and Holmqvist, 2016]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#strukelj-scheiter-nystrom-holmqvist-2016)). The results from the
    initial and later screens cancel each other out.

The explanation for why disfluency improves learning is that less
legible text needs to be processed more deeply to decipher the text.
This deeper processing creates an additional [cognitive load]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#cognitive-load) and this uses the resources of [working memory]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#working-memory). This is sometimes described as '[desirable difficulty]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#desirable-difficulty)' where the additional load is
considered beneficial. Some research aims to clarify the underlying
mechanisms.

-   *Disfluency or cognitive load*<br>
    A study by Eitel, Kühl, Scheiter, and Gerjets ([2014]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#eitel-kuhl-scheiter-gerjets-2014)) tested whether
    introducing less legible text and pictures in multimedia instruction
    has a disfluency effect (improving learning) or has a detrimental
    effect on learning through increasing the cognitive load. Three out
    of four of the studies were not consistent with the disfluency
    explanation, but neither did they support a cognitive load
    explanation. The researchers suggest that a less legible text layout
    may increase the perceptual load but not affect the [cognitive load.](#sn:cognitive-load)

-   *Measurement of brain activity*<br>
    The research stemming from the collaboration between
    neuropsychologists and a designer ([Keage, Coussens, Kohler, Thiessen, and Churches, 2014]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#keage-coussens-kohler-thiessen-churches-2014)) looking at brain activity suggests
    that less legible material might impose a cognitive load. When asked
    to do a task which requires recognising the same letter twice in a
    row with letters occurring in different typefaces, the brain
    activity they recorded indicates that not only is identifying the
    letter more difficult with less legible typefaces, but there is also
    a suggestion that more effort is necessary to integrate these into
    working memory. [Figure 6.7](#figure-6-7) illustrates which typefaces were used.

-   *Working memory capacity*<br>
    Those who promote the [positive effects of disfluency](#sn:positive-effects-of-disfluency) will say that increasing cognitive load and
    using up working memory capacity can be a good thing: a desirable
    difficulty. But this depends on our working memory capacity.
    Lehmann, Goussios, and Seufert ([2016]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#lehmann-goussios-seufert-2016)) used the typefaces shown in
    [Figure 6.8](#figure-6-8), which were also used in the original study by
    Diemand-Yauman, Oppenheimer, and Vaughan ([2011]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#diemand-yauman-oppenheimer-vaughan-2011)). Lehmann *et al*.
    found that people with a higher working memory capacity are better
    at retention (recall) and comprehension of less legible texts,
    whereas those with a lower working memory capacity are worse. If
    text is legible, it doesn't matter what our working memory capacity
    is. If we wish to design for a range of readers with varying working
    memory capacities we need to focus on making text more, and not
    less, legible.

I have a problem in distinguishing between perception and cognition as I don’t know where perception stops and cognition begins. I therefore treat this suggestion as an (over)enthusiastic attempt to explain the results.

# Conclusion

This last chapter has moved away from mainstream legibility but has
hopefully provided an insight into related areas of research. Most of
these can inform design practice but I would treat the concept of
introducing disfluency with extreme caution. There are other ways to
encourage readers to engage with text that do not make reading more
difficult.

You may feel that it was unnecessary to read quite so much about
psychological processes involved in reading or the detail of
experiments. If so, I expect you have skipped over these parts or
skimmed them. The book is designed to enable you to do this, to choose
your own reading strategy. If you developed an interest in how we read
and how research is carried out, I hope you will pursue this interest in
the future. We need to update our research knowledge base to keep track
with changes in screen-based technologies and different reading habits.
As a typographic or graphic designer, you can make an invaluable
contribution, especially if you are open to collaborating with other
disciplines.
