<p>ES_This is a comprehensive introduction to legibility, supported by an extensive glossary and bibliography. It updates and extends existing books summarising legibility research, some dating from as early as the 1960s. This text also adds more in-depth material to encourage deeper engagement. We hope it will provide a useful resource for designers who wish to learn more about research which might inform their thinking and practice. It is also relevant to readers from various disciplines who have an interest in how typographic variables affect how we read.</p>

<p>ES_Version 1.0 was published and printed in January 2019, designed by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Carlos-Perez-Ceron" target="_blank">Carlos Pérez Cerón</a>, with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-gonzalez-de-coss%C3%ADo-a1272b76/" target="_blank">María González de Cossío</a> as the editor.</p>
<p>ES_Version 2.0 has some edits based on feedback from Kevin Larson: a reference to CAPTCHAs is removed; 
    the results of studies on ClearType are clarified; letter frequency is included as a further 
    factor in legibility; a distinction is made between  critical type size and optimal type size; 
    a more recent study on letter, word, and line spacing is added; earlier research on disfluency 
    is included. This version was further revised for presentation on this website; the project is 
    sponsored by <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a>, produced by 
    <a href="https://rosettatype.com">Rosetta Type</a>, and implemented by
