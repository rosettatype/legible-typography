<p>In this text you will find ideas and research about legibility, i.e. ease of reading. You will find material of a diverse nature and complexity and some advanced concepts of reading supported by scientific research. The work is formulated as a textbook with some questions included for the reader. The text can be read at different levels: panels provide additional material or explanation; boxes describe the details of experiments.</p>

<p>Version 1.0 was published and printed in January 2019, designed by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Carlos-Perez-Ceron" target="_blank">Carlos Pérez Cerón</a>, with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-gonzalez-de-coss%C3%ADo-a1272b76/" target="_blank">María González de Cossío</a> as the editor.</p>
<p>Version 2.0 has some edits based on feedback from Kevin Larson: a reference to CAPTCHAs is removed; 
    the results of studies on ClearType are clarified; letter frequency is included as a further 
    factor in legibility; a distinction is made between  critical type size and optimal type size; 
    a more recent study on letter, word, and line spacing is added; earlier research on disfluency 
    is included. This version was further revised for presentation on this website; the project is 
    sponsoded by <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a> and implemented by <a href="https://underscoretype.com">Johannes Neumeier</a>.</p>
