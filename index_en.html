<h1>Foreword</h1>
<p>
    The invention of typography, print, and more recently digitization and the internet brought about an abundance of documents and made the need for legible communication unquestionable. The stakes are as high as the numbers of documents and readers. Professional typographers, graphic designers, UX designers, DTP operators, software developers, casual users of word-processing software, all in one way or another design documents thus affecting their ease of reading. But what exactly is legibility and how can we design documents that are easier to read?
</p>
<p>
    Traditional typographic knowledge based on conventions, technology, and personal or shared experience claims reliable answers proven by generations. Next to this, there has been a growing body of scientific research aiming to provide testable theories to critically assess such answers.
</p>
<p>
    Mary Dyson spent most of her academic life at the renowned Department of Typography & Graphic Communication at the University of Reading (UK). She has dedicated her career to research into reading and typography, writing numerous papers on the subject.
</p>
<p>
    In front of you is a digital version of her comprehensive introduction to legibility. It updates and extends existing books summarising contemporary legibility research.  Available in English and <a href="/es">Spanish</a>, it is a prime resource on typographic legibility available online. The work is formulated as a textbook encouraging critical reading. The complex research content is divided into <em>panels</em> providing additional material or explanation and <em>boxes</em> describing the details of experiments.
