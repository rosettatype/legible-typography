    The invention of typography, print, and more recently digitization and the internet brought about an abundance of documents and made the need for legible communication unquestionable. The stakes are as high as the numbers of documents and readers. Professional typographers, graphic designers, UX designers, DTP operators, software developers, casual users of word-processing software, all in one way or another design documents thus affecting their ease of reading. But what exactly is legibility and how can we design documents that are easier to read?
</p>
<p>
    Traditional typographic knowledge based on conventions, technology, and personal or shared experience claims reliable answers proven by generations. Next to this, there has been a growing body of scientific research aiming to provide testable theories to critically assess such answers.

    Mary C. Dyson spent most of her academic life at the renowned Department of Typography & Graphic Communication at the University of Reading (UK). She has dedicated her career to research into reading and typography and writing numerous papers on the subject. In front of you is a digital version of her comprehensive introduction to legibility. It updates and extends existing books summarising contemporary legibility research of diverse nature and complexity. The work is formulated as a textbook. To motivate critical reading, it engages the readers through a series of questions. The text can be read at different levels: panels provide additional material or explanation; boxes describe the details of experiments.

    The book is available in English and <a href="/es">Spanish</a>. The text was originally published at the Centro de Estudios Avanzados de Diseño (Puebla, México) in 2019 with María González de Cossío as the editor. It has been made available in this digital form and free of charge thanks to a generous donation from Google Fonts and production work of our team at Rosetta Type. We hope you will find it useful for your thinking, practice, or research.
