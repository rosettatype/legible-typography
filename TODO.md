Questions / TODO:

- Front page: Intro, vs TOC, vs custom design?

- Chapters:
    - References per chapter?

- Illustrations:
    - ~~EPS files with white background?~~
    - 5.30 new illustration?

- Sidenotes:
    - Where a sidenote in the book was the full URL for a link, these will just be links in the text; if wanted we can designate those links visually as "leading off-site"

- PDF:
  - Disable links... possibly with custom JS file passed to wkhtmltopdf?
  - Some fonts/headings still not working

Review notes:
- Any missed glossary terms?
- Do anchor links and bibli links work?
- Sidenotes, panels, figurecaptions arrangements
- Adopted style for single letters [a]
- Bibliography bold names, ok?
