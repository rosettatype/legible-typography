Questions / TODO:

- PDF:
  - Disable links... possibly with custom JS file passed to wkhtmltopdf?
  - Some fonts/headings still not working


- panels (details and boxes)
  - make foldable (should be folded by default)
  - make the offset like figures
  - make the colour background a bit lighter
- unify figure captions
  - the figure XYZ bold
  - could be styled as sidenotes
  - mostly next to the figure
  - under the figure only when it is a full-width illustration
  - when next to narrow illustration, use second half of the main area
  - *-footnotes about font sizes

- rename “index” to home/homepage/list of contents
  - make Download PDF version more prominent
  - make Spanish version more prominent (perhaps instead of Google sponsorship “banner”?)
  - bigger title
  - more prominent author
  - simpler list of chapters
  - put Bibliography, Glossary, and (maybe) the authors at the end of the chapter list
  - put change log after the chapter list
- add chapters in the menu
- question section could be neater
- some headlines use wrong optical size and negative tracking
