    the movement of our eyes when we read, how we recognize
    words. You will find excellent material of a diverse nature
    and complexity that will help understand the basic principles
    of typography, wrong ideas and practices that are
    common in the profession, and advanced concepts of
    reading on the screen supported by scientific research.
