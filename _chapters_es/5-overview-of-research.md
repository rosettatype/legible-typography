# Introduction

Legibility research up to about the 1980s explored printed material.
Herbert Spencer who had written an overview of legibility research in
1968 commented soon after that legibility research needs to be about
different forms of output and all media ([Spencer, 1970, p73]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#spencer-1970)). I doubt he
could have envisaged the current ubiquity of mobile phones and tablets,
but he did realise that new issues would arise without the constraints
of the printed page. Although some relatively recent studies have
focused on print legibility (e.g. [Lonsdale, 2006]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#lonsdale-dyson-reynolds-2006), [2007]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#lonsdale-2007)), investigations
of reading from and interacting with screens are probably now the more
common interests for [legibility research](#sn:legibility-research).

<aside id="sn:legibility-research">
These studies are not necessarily couched as legibility research; often emerging from a computer science/ergonomics/Human Computer Interaction (HCI) environment, they may be regarded as usability studies.
</aside>

In providing an overview of the outcomes of legibility research, I am
starting with type and building up from there. Research using material
presented on screens is discussed together with print, and comparisons
made where relevant. Rather than simply summarise the results, I also
include the context and objectives of the research because these can
affect how we interpret the results and relate them to design practice.
Although you may think that a clear set of guidelines and
recommendations on how to design to optimise legibility may be more
helpful, these would probably oversimplify and mislead. I think a better
approach is to try to understand how and why typographic and graphic
variables affect different aspects of reading to inform design
decisions, rather than prescribe how to design. [A set of guidelines](https://www.usability.gov/sites/default/files/documents/guidelines_book.pdf)
based on research are available covering web design and usability.

## Screen versus paper

A starting point for research into reading from screen was comparisons
with paper; Dillon ([1992]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#dillon-1992); [2004, Chapter 3]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#dillon-2004)) reviews these studies. In a
sense, these were legibility studies as they used measures such as speed
of reading and the results usually indicated that reading from screen
was slower. At the time, they were helpful in informing educators, but
had limited practical application for designers looking for guidance on
optimal legibility, unless they were deciding between using screen or
print. The results have less relevance today as these older studies from
the 1980s and 1990s used cathode ray tube (CRT) technology, now obsolete
and replaced with thin film transistor liquid crystal displays
(TFT-LCD). These have the advantages of higher display resolution and
other improvements in image quality and text presentation capabilities.
[Panel 5.1](#panel-5-1) describes a study looking at [anti-aliasing]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#anti-aliasing)
and whether this improves legibility.

<aside class="panel expandable" id="panel-5-1" markdown="1">

# Panel 5.1: Description of anti-aliasing technique: sub-pixel rendering

Operating systems now use techniques of anti-aliasing and sub-pixel
rendering which means that text on screen is close to the quality of
printed text. An example of sub-pixel rendering is ClearType, developed
by Microsoft in 2000. This technology renders text on screen by
separately addressing red, green, and blue sub-pixels with the aim of
increasing text legibility.

A relatively small number of studies have tested reader performance and
preference with ClearType. The results are somewhat inconsistent which
might be due to the different tasks, the choice of technology for
comparison, and individual preferences for colour filtering. ClearType
text has been found to increase reading speed when compared with
non-ClearType ([Dillon, Kleinman, Bias, Choi, and Turnbull, 2004]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#dillon-kleinman-bias-choi-turnbull-2004);
[Slattery and Rayner, 2010]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#slattery-rayner-2010)) but no functional improvements were
identified when compared with perceptually-tuned grayscale, a different
level of ClearType ([Sheedy, Tai, Subbaram, Gowrisankaran, and Hayes, 2008]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#sheedy-tai-subbaram-gowrisankaran-hayes-2008)). 
In this study, moderate ClearType rendering was preferred to text
with grayscale or higher-level ClearType contrast, being perceived as
improving clarity and contrast.

</aside>

Along with backlit LCD displays we have dedicated e-book readers with
electronic paper or electronic ink (eInk) screens deliberately
resembling paper. Given the changes in technology, there are now fewer
differences between material in print and on screen and readers also
have greater familiarity with [reading from screens](#sn:reading-from-screens).

<aside id="sn:reading-from-screens" markdown="1">

A comparison of five e-readers and one paper book found very similar reading behaviour, measured by eye movements. There was also a suggestion that e-readers might improve legibility as readers are able to adjust font size 
([Siegenthaler, Wurtz, Bergamin, and Groner, 2011]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#siegenthaler-wurtz-bergamin-groner-2011)).

</aside>

However, some ergonomic differences remain, particularly with desktop
computers, such as the distance between reader and material (greater
distance for screens), and angle of material to reader ([Figure 5.1](#figure-5-1)).
Other differences between print and smaller screens (tablets and phones)
are primarily related to how text is structured and how we interact with
it, and possibly less to do with reading at the level of individual
letters and words.

<figure id="figure-5-1">
    <img src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/figure-5-1.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Distance between reading material and eyes">
    <figcaption class="aside" markdown="1">

**Figura 5.1:** The distance between reading material and our eyes and the
angle of viewing varies depending on the device. This means that the
visual angle of type is relevant as the same type size will subtend a
smaller angle at a larger distance (see 
[Figure 3.2]({% link _chapters_en/3-perspectives-on-legibility.md %}#figure-3-2)).

</figcaption>
</figure>

There has been a recent revival of studies comparing reading from screen
and print. These have sought to discover whether reading from screen is
still more difficult than reading print. The results suggest that the
legibility of text on screen is no longer a problem, although
positioning the screen to resemble the angle at which paper is normally
read (a display inclination angle of 15°) may be necessary to reduce
eyestrain. [Box 5.1](#box-5-1) describes more details of the study.

> Questions: Do you prefer reading from a screen or paper? Does this
depend on what you are reading? Might your preference change if you used
a non-preferred method for a reasonably long period of time? Do we
simply prefer what we are most used to doing?

# Box 5.1: Details of recent study comparing paper and screen reading

A recent study by German psychologists ([Köpper, Mayr, and Buchner, 2016]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#kopper-mayr-buchner-2016))
comparing paper and screen used:

-   an Apple MacBook Pro with a TFT-LCD widescreen display, backlit by
    an LED, on a 15.4 inch screen at a resolution of 1680 x 1050 pixels,
    128 ppi (pixels per inch)

-   an Apple iPad 2

-   a 210 x 297 mm sheet of white high quality paper printed using a 600
    dpi (dots per inch) laser printer

They measured proofreading accuracy and speed of reading and found no
differences between screen and paper. However, screen reading resulted
in reports of a stronger degree of eyestrain and reading print was
preferred. Reducing the screen luminance did not help but using an iPad
which was displayed at the same angle as paper removed the difference in
eyestrain symptoms and increased proofreading speed from screen.

# Type

A perhaps surprising conclusion from various studies is that typefaces
in common use for text (as opposed to display or ornamental typefaces)
do not show differences in performance, typically measured by speed of
reading and comprehension ([Figure 5.2](#figure-5-2)). The traditional research studies
are summarised in Tinker ([1963]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#tinker-1963), [1965]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#tinker-1965)).

<figure id="figure-5-2">
    <img class="padding" src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/figure-5-2.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Reading speed in three radically different typefaces">
    <figcaption class="aside" markdown="1">

**Figura 5.2:** One of the traditional studies included seven frequently
used typefaces and three radically different ones. Cloister Black was
read the slowest; Garamond was one of the seven which showed no
differences in reading speed 
([Paterson and Tinker, 1932]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#paterson-tinker-1932) summarised in
[Tinker, 1963, 46–47]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#tinker-1963)).

</figcaption>
</figure>

Comparing on-screen typefaces, even those specifically designed for
screen (e.g. Georgia, Verdana, Trebuchet, Tahoma) we find that they may
not help us read faster, but also do not slow us down. Differences
emerge with rather obscure and unusual typefaces that look radically
different to the others. For example, a difference is found when
comparing Tahoma (sans serif) with an ornate typeface, Corsiva 
([Figure 5.3](#figure-5-3)).

<figure id="figure-5-3">
    <img class="padding" src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/figure-5-3.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Comparing different typefaces">
    <figcaption class="aside" markdown="1">
    
**Figura 5.3:** As with print-based studies, differences emerge only when
comparing text typefaces (e.g. Tahoma) with ornate typefaces (e.g. Corsiva) 
([Bernard, Mills, Peterson, and Storrer, 2001]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#bernard-mills-peterson-storrer-2001)).

</figcaption>
</figure>

Readers' opinions of relative legibility (subjective judgements) do
discriminate between typefaces but this is not usually linked with
differences in how they are read ([Box 5.2](#box-5-2)). On the whole, typefaces
which have been designed for screen, or are used frequently, are
perceived as easier to read and preferred ([Boyarski, Neuwirth, Forizzi, and Regli, 1998]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#boyarski-neuwirth-forlizzi-regli-1998); [Bernard, Mills, Peterson, and Storrer, 2001]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#bernard-mills-peterson-storrer-2001)). They tend
to have a larger x-height, wider characters, more open counters and less
variation in stroke width.

<aside class="box expandable" id="box-5-2" markdown="1">

# Box 5.2: Details of study comparing perceived and actual legibility

A study carried out as part of an undergraduate dissertation at the
University of Reading, UK looked at the link between how readers judge
legibility and how well they identify words ([Thompson, 2009]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#thompson-2009)). It also
explored whether perceptions of legibility change after doing a
legibility test. In other words, do readers know how they perform in a
test? Are readers able to use their performance to inform their
judgements?

Ten typefaces were used (see [Figure 5.4](#figure-5-4)) with five described as
conventional (Caslon, Courier, Georgia, Helvetica, Times) and five as
unconventional (Comic Sans, Corsiva, Curlz MT, Impact, Trajan). These
were matched, as far as possible, on the size of the x-heights, not
point size (see [Chapter 4: Comparing typefaces]({% link _chapters_en/4-what-is-measured-and-how.md %}#comparing-typefaces)).

<figure class="side-by-side" id="figure-5-4">

</figcaption>
</figure>

> Questions: Do you think the categorisations of conventional and
unconventional are appropriate? What about Comic Sans? What features or
characteristics make a typeface conventional? Which category of typeface
(conventional or unconventional) do you think is more legible?
{: .question }

Two groups of participants were tested: ten designers and ten
non-designers. The study proceeded as follows:

-   Compare pairs of typefaces (see [Chapter 4: Paired comparisons]({% link _chapters_en/4-what-is-measured-and-how.md %}#paired-comparisons)) and
    identify the one perceived as more legible

-   Report single words presented on screen for a short time

-   Again compare pairs of typefaces and identify the one perceived as
    more legible

As you probably can predict, the conventional typefaces were judged as
more legible than the unconventional. This was true for designers and
non-designers although the difference was more marked for designers. The
pattern of results was essentially the same before and after the word
identification test; Caslon and Georgia did switch places but their
scores were very similar. ([Figure 5.5](#figure-5-5))

> Pregunta: Can you suggest why designers might have a stronger bias
towards perceiving conventional typefaces as more legible than
unconventional ones?
{: .question }

The typefaces that were read most easily also grouped according to
conventional and unconventional, with conventional more legible. There
was one clear exception which was Comic Sans which turns out to be easy
to read ([Figure 5.6](#figure-5-6)). Yet readers don't judge it as easy to read (ranked
6 out of 10). Why not?

</aside><!-- end .box#5-2 -->

Occasionally research finds a difference among typefaces when care has
been taken to make the experiment as sensitive as possible (see [Chapter 4: Challenges]({% link _chapters_en/4-what-is-measured-and-how.md %}#challenges)*)*. For example, an advantage has been demonstrated for
the sans serif Gill Medium over other sans serif typefaces but no
differences between serif and sans serif typefaces ([Poulton, 1965]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#poulton-1965)). His
method was to limit reading time of passages of text to 90 seconds and
measure how much was comprehended through open-ended questions with
short answers (easier to score). This study used two versions of
Univers: one matching the other typefaces in terms of x-height; the
other matching point size ([Figure 5.7](#figure-5-7)).

## Serif versus sans serif

One of the more common and somewhat controversial debates concerns the
relative legibility of serif and sans serif typefaces. Comparisons of
serif and sans serif typefaces typically find no differences in speed of
reading or comprehension*.* In a critical review of 72 studies that
compare different typefaces, Lund ([1999]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#lund-1999)) found no valid conclusion in
favour of either serif or sans serif typefaces. [Box 5.3](#box-5-3) describes one
study supposedly showing an advantage for a serif face.

# Box 5.3: Critique of study comparing serif and sans serif type

One study which appears to contradict the lack of any reliable
difference between reading serif and sans serif typefaces is reported in
a booklet and was subsequently incorporated into a book ([Wheildon, 1986]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#wheildon-1986), [1995]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#wheildon-1995)). Comprehension was measured for an article with a serif type
(Corona) and compared with a sans serif (Helvetica). The results show an
unbelievable difference in comprehension:

-   67% of readers had good comprehension levels for serif type

-   12% of readers had good comprehension levels for sans serif type

The size of the difference between these two typefaces is astonishing in
comparison with the results of other researchers. Assuming the results
are reported accurately, the method of testing may be responsible for
the extraordinary nature of the findings. The method is described only
briefly, not reaching the standard required for scientific publications,
and it is worth noting that this research was not published in an
academic journal. Some aspects of the brief account of the method reveal
a lack of understanding of experimental procedures. Readers are asked
'leading questions about their attitudes to the articles and layout of
the pages' ([Wheildon, 1995, p9]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#wheildon-1995)). Also worrying is Wheildon's concern
that the results may have been biased or distorted if he had not done
all the work himself.

I include this example because it has been treated seriously by some
writers who have not questioned the reliability or validity of the
findings. Rather than uncritically citing these results as evidence for
differences in legibility, they should be evaluated alongside the
majority of other research which has not found the same huge
differences.

</aside><!-- end .box#5-3 -->

These comparisons of sans and serif typefaces used existing typefaces
which therefore vary in a number of ways other than presence or absence
of serifs ([Chapter 4: Comparing typefaces]({% link _chapters_en/4-what-is-measured-and-how.md %}#comparing-typefaces)). These differences include
thickness of stems, lengths of ascenders and descenders, character
widths, ratios of thin to thick stroke widths. More recently some
studies have aimed to isolate the effect of serifs from these other
variables; researchers have found it easier to manipulate typefaces and
change individual characteristics with the introduction of digital type.
However, expertise is required in these manipulations as there is an
interrelationship of elements in a well-designed typeface, within and
among letters, which can be disrupted.

This expertise was incorporated into a study carried out by a
mathematician, Robert A. Morris, with vision scientist colleagues, by
involving a type designer, Charles Bigelow. This study has been referred
to above in relation to combining disciplines ([Chapter 3]({% link _chapters_en/3-perspectives-on-legibility.md %})) and the
challenge of comparing typefaces ([Chapter 4]({% link _chapters_en/4-what-is-measured-and-how.md %}#comparing-typefaces)). The researchers compared a
serif and sans serif version of Lucida, designed by Bigelow and Holmes.
The underlying forms are identical with the major variation the presence
or absence of serifs which results in a slight increase in the black
area of the serif version. They used a small (about 4 point) and large
(about 16 point) size and found that serifs slowed down reading at the
small size, but there were no differences at the large size.

<aside id="sn:lucida">
These studies (and others involving Perea) were carried out in Spanish, whereas all other research cited uses English, unless stated otherwise.
</aside>

The sans and serif versions of Lucida have been tested more recently
looking at [words and sentences](#sn:lucida).

-   With words, the sans serif version was responded to quicker than the
    serif version ([Moret-Tatay and Perea, 2011]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#moret-tatay-perea-2011)).

-   The second study ([Perea, 2013]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#perea-2013)) wished to find out if there is an
    advantage for a serif typeface over a sans serif during ordinary
    reading. Publication norms, such as the American Psychological
    Association (APA), specify that [manuscripts]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#manuscripts) should
    be submitted to journals using a serif typeface like Times New
    Roman. This might suggest that they believe the text will be easier
    to read in a serif typeface. The study found that the differences
    are minimal and did not show the same slight advantage for sans
    serif found with individual words. (See [Box 5.4](#box-5-4) for further details
    of methods of all the Lucida studies)

<aside class="box expandable" id="box-5-4" markdown="1">

# Box 5.4: Details of studies using Lucida

The study by Morris, Aquilante, Yager, and Bigelow ([2002]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#morris-aquilante-yager-bigelow-2002)) used sentences
presented on screen using RSVP (see [Chapter 4: Threshold and related
measures]({% link _chapters_en/4-what-is-measured-and-how.md %}#threshold-and-related-measures)) and displayed these at a distance. Characters with an
x-height of 40 pixels at a 4-metre distance equates to about 4 point
type at a normal reading distance (40 cm). By increasing the size of the
type, characters could be rendered appropriately (i.e. sufficient
pixels). Displaying a 4 point type on screen might have resulted in
problems. By viewing at a distance, the visual angle is reduced and the
characters appear smaller. (See description of visual angles, [Panel 3.1]({% link _chapters_en/3-perspectives-on-legibility.md %}#panel-3-1),
as a reminder of the relationship between size and distance). The large
(16 point) type was produced with an x-height of 160 pixels at a 4-metre
distance.

Moret-Tatay and Perea ([2011]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#moret-tatay-perea-2011)) used individual words and a [lexical decision task]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#lexical-decision-task) which involves deciding whether
the item is a word or a non-word. This task requires us to not only
identify letters but process them to the point of matching them with a
word (or not).

Perea ([2013]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#perea-2013)) decided it was important to use a setting closer to typical
reading than the lexical decision task and RSVP (used by [Morris *et al.*, 2002]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#morris-aquilante-yager-bigelow-2002)). One-line sentences in 14 point Lucida or Lucida Sans were
read on screen and eye movements were monitored.

</aside><!-- end .box#5-4 -->

Reasons proposed for the advantage of serif typefaces for reading
continuous text are that the serifs:

-   contribute to the individuality of letters (yes, possibly)

-   make words and lines hang together (no)

-   guide the eye along the line of text (no)

The first reason is plausible as we know that the individuality of
letters is important; the easier it is to differentiate letters, the
easier it will be to read. However, there are other means of making
letters more discriminable than adding serifs (see Letter features,
below). See [Panel 5.2](#panel-5-2) for explanations as to why the last two reasons
don't fit with what we know about reading.

<aside class="panel expandable" id="panel-5-2" markdown="1">

# Panel 5.2: Critique of the role of serifs in reading

There is no evidence that serifs have the functions of keeping letters
in words together or words in lines. These are two quite distinct
functions and neither fit with what we know about reading. It is
possible that this explanation stems, in part, from the mistaken belief
that we use word shape, rather than individual letters, to recognise
words. Letter and word spacing (covered below) may affect the ease with
which we recognise letters and words.

There are reasons why serifs are unlikely to guide the eye along the
line of text. We use our peripheral (parafoveal) vision to guide where
we land our eyes following a saccade. The targets for saccades are
probably determined by the location of word boundaries. The serifs would
be much less effective at guiding the landing points of the saccades
because the detail of serifs is largely missing in our peripheral
vision; our visual acuity decreases with distance from the fovea.

</aside><!-- end .panel#5-2 -->

## Individual letters 

Tinker explored the relative legibility of lower case letters
(summarised in Tinker, [1963]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#tinker-1963)). He concluded that some letters are
intrinsically more legible than others because they are more
discriminable, i.e. they have certain distinguishing features.

-   High legibility: `d m p q w`

-   Medium legibility: `j r v x y`

-   Low legibility: `c e i n l`

Tinker came up with this order from most to least legible: \
`k d q b p m w f h j y r t x v z c o a u g e i n s l`

The reasons given by Tinker for these differences in legibility are:

-   some letter pairs may be confused such as `c` and `e`; `i` and `j`; `i` and `l`

-   narrower letters (`e` or `i`) are less legible than wider letters (`m` and `w`)

-   simpler outlines (`w` and `q`) are more legible than more complex outlines (`a` and `g`)

-   having a distinguishing characteristic aids legibility such that `b d p q k` will be more legible than `n` and `u`

Another possible reason for differences in legibility is [letter
frequency]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#letter-frequency). The accuracy of identifying a letter
([Larson and Carter, 2016]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#larson-carter-2016)) and the speed of determining whether an item is a letter or a non-letter 
([New and Grainger, 2011]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#new-grainger-2011)) have been found to
correlate with the letter's frequency. We might expect that the more
often we encounter a letter, the easier it is to identify. However, not
all studies have found this effect, and this includes Tinker who
reported no relation or a small negative correlation between letter
frequency and legibility with lower case letters ([Tinker, 1928]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#tinker-1928)).

As we cannot choose to compose a text that avoids letters of low
legibility, or low frequency, these deductions are not particularly
helpful. They may guide type designers as to where attention might be
focused to improve the legibility of their typefaces, or help the design
of logotypes. But as graphic designers choosing a typeface for use in
particular circumstances (e.g. low illumination) or for specific groups
of readers (e.g. visually impaired, beginner readers), we need to know
which features of typefaces, not letters, influence legibility. Tinker
did include some direction on the shape of serifs and which letters they
are applied to; the ratio between thick and thin stroke widths
(modulation); and the size of counters (white space within letters).
However, these suggestions were not supported by experiments and were
also influenced by the printing processes of the time. We should
therefore look to more recent research.

## Letter features

Psychological research has shown that we detect simple features of
letters, in order to identify the letters. These were previously
described as 'distinctive features' emphasising their role in providing
cues to differentiating the letters. In [Chapter 2]({% link _chapters_en/2-how-we-read.md %}) I mentioned that
researchers who develop models of reading have tended to assume that the
font will not affect how letters are identified. But more recent
research indicates that if there are more features, we are less
efficient at identifying the letters. More complex forms, e.g. ornate
typefaces, have more features ([Panel 5.3](#panel-5-3)). Therefore, what Tinker
deduced, but did not test, appears to be correct although he was
referring to different letters rather than different typefaces. Simpler
outlines are more legible than complex outlines. The example in 
[Figure 5.8](#figure-5-8) is exaggerated, as we wouldn't consider a script typeface (with a
complex outline) to be suitable for reading continuous text, but a
comparison of these two typefaces illustrates the point.

<figure id="figure-5-8">
    <img class="padding" src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/figure-5-8.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Kunstler Script compared with Arial">
    <figcaption class="aside"><strong>Figura 5.8:</strong> Kunstler Script, 36 point (top) is compared with Arial, 24 point (bottom).</figcaption>
</figure>

Simpler forms of some letters have been developed for children's reading
based on the view held by many teachers that children will find it
easier to read letters that are similar in shape to those they write.
The modified letters are described as 'infant characters' and the
differences are most apparent in the `a` and `g` (see [Figure 5.9](#figure-5-9)). A
study by Walker and Reynolds ([2003]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#walker-reynolds-2003)) found no differences between
typefaces with and without infant characters in terms of errors when
children between 5 and 7 years old read aloud. The children were aware
of the different forms, with some able to identify which they read and
which they used in writing. These results suggest that non-infant
characters are not problematic and they do not necessarily help in
discriminating among letters.

# Panel 5.3: How perimetric complexity is measured

How do we measure complexity? One way is perimetric complexity which
compares the perimeter (the inside and outside edge) to the overall area
of the letters which is described as the 'ink' (the area covered by
pixels). The precise formula is the inside and outside perimeter (p)
squared, divided by the total ink (a).

<code>p² / a</code>

A convoluted or elaborate form will have a larger perimeter compared to
total area and therefore be more complex. Perimetric complexity is not
exactly the same as peoples' subjective ratings of complexity; these
tend to reflect the number of turns in the outline. ([Pelli, Burns, Farell, and Moore-Page, 2006]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#pelli-burns-farell-moore-page-2006)).
</aside><!-- end .panel#5-3 -->

This century, a number of psychological studies have aimed to identify
the particular features that are most important in identifying letters.
Unfortunately, they have produced different answers which means that
further research is necessary to clarify our knowledge. The reasons for
different conclusions may be because of variation in the:

-   way letters are divided into components

-   method of testing

-   typeface used in the test

-   case, either upper or lower case, or both

To add to the confusion, the terminology for the different letter parts
doesn't always coincide with the more precise descriptions of type
designers. Also, there isn't always consistency in terminology across
studies. In outlining the results of four of these studies, I will
introduce a consistent terminology. Designers talk of 'strokes' rather
than lines, reflecting a calligraphic origin, and the components can be
described as:

-   stroke terminals or endings (rather than terminations) which will
    differ in a serif typeface; this means that the features underlying
    letter recognition may depend on the typeface

-   stroke junctions (sometimes called intersections or vertices)

-   mid segments which can include vertical, horizontal, diagonal or
    curved strokes

One of the original studies to explore the role of various components of
letters used the typeface Courier ([Petit and Grainger, 2002]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#petit-grainger-2002)). They found
that mid segments of letters play a critical role in letter
identification (see [Figure 5.10](#figure-5-10)).

<figure id="figure-5-10">
    <img src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/figure-5-10.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Complete letters in Courier">
    <figcaption class="aside"><strong>Figura 5.10:</strong> Complete letters in Courier upper case (top); letters with
only the stroke junctions (middle); letters with only the mid segments (bottom).</figcaption>
</figure>

Some years later, two studies using the typeface Arial report that
stroke terminals (in particular) and horizontal lines (a form of mid
segment) are important cues to letter identity for both upper and lower
case letters; stroke junctions are quite important for uppercase; and
slants tilted right (another type of mid segment) are more useful for
identifying lowercase than uppercase ([Fiset, Blais, Éthier-Majcher, Arguin, Bub, and Gosselin, 2008]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#fiset-blais-ethier-majcher-arguin-bub-gosselin-2008); 
[Fiset, D., Blais, C., Arguin, M., Tadros, K., Éthier-Majcher, C., Bub, D., et al., 2009]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#fiset-blais-arguin-tadros-ethier-majcher-bub-et-al-2009)). [Figure 5.11](#figure-5-11) shows these parts
of letters.

horizontal strokes are again used in identifying upper
and lower case letters. On the right the stroke junctions that
are most relevant in identifying upper case letters, and the diagonal
strokes tilted right, used as cues in lower case.</figcaption>
</figure>

Around the same time, Lanthier, Risko, Stolzh, and Besner ([2009]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#lanthier-risko-stolzh-besner-2009)) found
that taking out the stroke junctions from Arial Narrow upper case
letters makes letter and word identification more difficult compared to
taking out the mid segments (see [Figure 5.12](#figure-5-12)). This suggests that stroke
junctions are important in letter identification.

</figure>

The fourth study, again exploring which components of letters are more
important in words, uses the typeface Minion 
([Rosa, Perea, and Enneson, 2016]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#rosa-perea-enneson-2016)). 
Their results show that the mid-segments are the most important
for identification, followed by stroke junctions; terminals do not
appear to be critical. [Figure 5.13](#figure-5-13) illustrates the removal of each of
the three components as this manipulation was used to determine the
contribution of each. As this study used a serif typeface (in contrast
to a sans serif, Arial), removing terminals may have less impact.

into components and the different methods of testing.

<aside class="box expandable" id="box-5-5" markdown="1">

# Box 5.5: Methods used to identify letter features

One way in which the procedures used in the studies vary is whether
components of the letters are removed or certain components selected for
inclusion. It may seem as though the outcome would be the same but this
is not the case as there are other parts to the letter (see [Figure 5.14](#figure-5-14)). The fourth study I reported ([Rosa, Perea, and Enneson, 2016]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#rosa-perea-enneson-2016))
includes both procedures: they started by including components and did
not find any differences among mid segments, stroke junctions and
terminals. When they changed to deleting each of the components, they
did find differences (see [Figure 5.13](#figure-5-13)).

The methods used to measure letter or word identification include:

-   [priming]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#priming) with alphabetic decision or letter
    identification: a full letter or part of a letter ([Figure 5.10](#figure-5-10)) is
    shown for a very short time (30 or 50 msecs) and then the same
    complete letter is shown and the participant says whether it is a
    letter or not (alphabetic decision) or says which letter it is
    (letter identification)

-   delayed segment with lexical decision: a part of the word is
    displayed very briefly followed by the whole word and the
    participant says if it is a word or not a word

-   straightforward letter and word identification, i.e. name the letter
    or word

-   a classification image technique which essentially varies the amount
    of the letter displayed over time and the participant identifies the
    letter
</aside><!-- end .box#5-5 -->

Comparing the results from the four groups of researchers indicates that
we don't yet have a clear picture of how we identify a letter. Two
studies highlight mid segments as important, one stroke junctions and
another terminals. As yet, I am not aware of any study which compares
different typefaces (upper and lower case) using one of these methods to
see if the components or features we use to differentiate letters depend
on the [typeface characteristics](#sn:typeface-characteristics).

<aside id="sn:typeface-characteristics">
In psychology, and science in general, this would not be considered the most parsimonious explanation, i.e. not the simplest. However, it would be interesting to test.
</aside>

A more typographical perspective is to look at serifs which can function
as terminals and may contribute to differentiating some letters. But why
do no clear differences emerge when serif and sans serif typefaces are
compared? A possible contributory factor is that serifs can improve the
discriminability of some letters (i.e. make them less similar to other
letters) but serifs may also make other letters less discriminable, and
therefore liable to misrecognition. Therefore at some stroke endings
serifs may help, but not at all endings. [Box 5.6](#box-5-6) describes some studies
which address this issue focusing on specific letters.

<aside class="box expandable" id="box-5-6" markdown="1">

# Box 5.6: Details of studies looking at the contribution of serifs

Some time ago, Harris ([1973]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#harris-1973)) compared the legibility of individual
letters in two sans serif typefaces (Univers 689 and Gill Sans Medium)
and one serif typeface (Baskerville 169). The letters were shown off
centre in a tachistoscope, for brief viewing. His results suggested that
serifs can close up open counters, impairing recognition, but in other
letters the serif enhances gaps. As he used existing typefaces, the
results may be attributed to aspects of the typeface other than serifs
(e.g. x-height, letter contrast, weight).

A study by Beier and Dyson ([2014]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#beier-dyson-2014)) followed up on this looking at the
same individual lower case letters (`j i l b h n u a`). The letters
were set in the typeface Ovink, a sans serif typeface designed for
distance viewing, and a new slab serif version which differed only in
relation to the added serifs. The typefaces are designed by Sofie Beier
(see [Figure 5.15](#figure-5-15)).

<figure id="figure-5-15">
    <img class="transparent" src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/figure-5-15.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Ovink with different without and with serifs">
    <figcaption><strong>Figura 5.15:</strong> The two versions of Ovink differing only in relation to the
serifs.</figcaption>
</figure>

In this case, the role that serifs play when letters are viewed at a
distance was explored. We found that serifs at vertical extremes 
(`l b h n u`) facilitate letter recognition but in letters `i` and `j`, serifs do
not help. The serif is not at the vertical extreme because of the dot.
In these letters, the serifs may remove the narrow character of these
two letters resulting in lower legibility. See [Figure 5.16](#figure-5-16).

<figure id="figure-5-16">
    <img class="transparent" src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/figure-5-16.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Recommendations">
    <figcaption markdown="1">
    
**Figura 5.16:** Recommendations from Beier and Dyson 
([2014]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#beier-dyson-2014)): remove serifs
when not at extremes (`i`); `h` can be confused with `b` so recommended that
serifs removed from the counter of `h`.

</figcaption>
</figure>

These outcomes support the general conclusion that serifs can be both
helpful and unhelpful in letter recognition. This tends to make choosing
a typeface rather complicated but helps to explain why we don't find
differences in performance when comparing serif and sans serif.

Unfortunately, the conclusions are even less straightforward as
different results can be obtained when looking at individual letters
viewed in parafoveal vision (off centre), rather than at a distance.
This has important implications for designers in choosing typefaces for
specific contexts.
</aside><!-- end .box#5-6 -->

Another approach to determining which features influence legibility has
focused on individual letter confusions such as those proposed by Tinker
(i.e. `c` and `e`). The objectives were to provide recommendations for
specific design elements for onscreen reading and situations where codes
or single characters need to be quickly and accurately identified, such
as air traffic control displays 
([Fox, Chaparro, and Merkle, 2007]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#fox-chaparro-merkle-2007)). 
[Box 5.7](#box-5-7) describes what this study found.

<aside class="box expandable" id="box-5-7" markdown="1">

# Box 5.7: Outcomes of study looking at letter `e`

We do have some insight into the particular difficulties with the letter
`e`, which can be mistaken for a `c` or `o`. Comparing 20 typefaces, an
`e` in Verdana was always correctly identified whereas an `e` in
Garamond was only correct 10% of the time. Using a statistical
procedure, the researchers determined that the problem with Garamond is
the higher bar compared to overall height. Surprisingly, the overall
size was not important. Although this result seems plausible, we might
instead describe the difference as a smaller counter (see [Figure 5.17](#figure-5-17)).

<figure class="side-by-side" id="figure-5-17">
    <img class="transparent" src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/figure-5-17.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Higher e bar in Garamond">
    <figcaption><strong>Figura 5.17:</strong> Garamond (left) has a higher bar, in relation to overall
height, than Verdana (right). This results in Garamond having a smaller
counter.</figcaption>
</figure>

Letter features have been researched from psychological and design
perspectives, the former aiming to formulate more general theories of
letter processing and the latter focusing on specific details. They
therefore complement each other. A useful way forward might be to
establish whether the general theories apply to all typefaces by
comparing typefaces with very different characteristics.

</aside><!-- end .box#5-7 -->

## Upper versus lower halves of letters and words

An effect which can be very easily demonstrated is the relative ease of
reading text when only the top halves of letters are available compared
with the bottom halves ([Figure 5.18](#figure-5-18)). This is obviously not a way in
which we would set text, but it may tell us something about how we read,
for example through eye movements. This knowledge may help us, perhaps
indirectly, in making design decisions.

Huey ([1908/1968]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#huey-1908-1968)) observed the advantage to perception of the upper half
claiming that

> ...the upper half of a word or letter is obviously more important for
perception than is the lower half.
Huey ([1968, p98]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#huey-1908-1968))

<figure id="figure-5-18">
    <img src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/figure-5-18.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Visible top halves versus visible bottom halves">
    <figcaption class="aside"><strong>Figura 5.18:</strong> It is easier to read the text when the top halves of
letters are visible than when we only see the bottom halves.</figcaption>
</figure>

This was explained in an early printers' handbook *Typographical
printing-surfaces: the technology and mechanism of their production* by
Legros and Grant ([1916]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#legros-grant-1916)) as more frequent letters projecting above the
middle line. [Letter frequency]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#letter-frequency) counts can vary depending on how they have
been counted, what content is used, and the language. However, despite
differences the consensus is that the first letter with a descender (`p`
or `g` in English and probably `p` in Spanish) is number 16 in terms of
frequency; there are 4 or 5 letters with ascenders that are more
frequent than `p`. Logically, this tells us that there will be more
letter parts above the midline than below which can disambiguate the
letter. A comparison of the level of ambiguity in the lower and upper
part of letters across some European languages ([Tejero, Perea, and Jiménez, 2014]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#tejero-perea-jimenez-2014)) shows similarities:

-   English: 68% of letters are ambiguous in lower part; 51% ambiguous
    in upper part

-   Spanish: 68% of letters ambiguous in lower part; 50% ambiguous in
    upper part

-   French: 68% of letters ambiguous in lower part; 50% ambiguous in
    [upper part](#sn:ambiguous)

<aside id="sn:ambiguous">
If you are wondering why the percentages add up to more than 100% (as I was initially), this is because some letters are ambiguous in both their lower and upper parts.
</aside>

By examining eye movements, we know that the eye fixates for longer when
reading the lower half compared to the upper half, indicating that
removing the upper half produces a greater cost to reading ([Perea, 2012]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#perea-2012)). The research described above which identified the features of
letters we use to distinguish one letter from another did not find a
bias towards features in the upper parts of letters. The bias we see in
the demonstration ([Figure 5.18](#figure-5-18)) appears to be restricted to letters in
the context of words. This is because words do not have equal numbers of
each letter but have more letters that are ambiguous in their lower part
(in the Latin alphabet). This is evidenced by a clever experiment which
controlled the number of ambiguous letters in the top and bottom half of
words and removed the effect ([Tejero, Perea, and Jiménez, 2014]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#tejero-perea-jimenez-2014)).

## Upper versus lower case

Unlike comparisons of different typefaces, a fairly consistent result is
that all upper case (capitals) slows down reading compared with lower
case or sentence case (where the beginnings of sentences are
capitalised). In the past, this was attributed to the loss of word shape
(ascenders and descenders) in upper case, but as we read by identifying
individual letters, this cannot be the explanation. We are more familiar
with reading lower case in continuous text which can account for this
[advantage](#sn:advantage). This explanation
is proposed by a very recent study which found that when reading
sentences, words in upper case were more likely to be re-fixated (looked
at again) than words in lowercase ([Perea, Rosa, and Marcet, 2017]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#perea-rosa-marcet-2017)). The
researchers suggest that we do an initial familiarity check before we
move our eyes to the next location and this check is more likely to be a
match with stored words if we are reading more familiar visual forms.

<aside id="sn:advantage">
There are differences between Mexico and the UK in the typography of signs in the environment. For example, traffic signs in Mexico are in upper case, whereas the UK changed from all capitals to lower case with initial capitals. However, this is unlikely to affect our familiarity with reading continuous text.
</aside>

However, at the same point size, upper case is larger than lower case.
Should the x-height of lower case be equal to the cap height when we
make comparisons in experiments?

-   If lower case (bold) letters approximately match the x-heights of
    upper case ([Figure 5.19](#figure-5-19)), headlines are located faster in lower case
    ([Poulton, 1967]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#poulton-1967)).

-   If we don't adjust but compare Arial in the same point size for caps
    and lower case ([Figure 5.20](#figure-5-20)), upper case appears to be more legible
    ([Arditi and Cho, 2007]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#arditi-cho-2007)). This is logical as the upper case letters
    are larger. For readers with normal vision, reading is quicker for
    upper case when at acuity limits, but this advantage goes when using
    a larger size that is typical of regular reading conditions.

All of this seems to point to the physical size of letters being
important, as well as familiarity, i.e. what we are used to reading.

## Type size

If we remain at the level of letters, explaining legibility would seem
to be very straightforward:

> The size and shape of printed symbols determine the legibility of text. <br>Legge and Bigelow ([2011, p1]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#legge-bigelow-2011))

Shapes have been covered above in some detail and differences between
upper and lower case led to the conclusion that size may be more
relevant than shape.

One approach to finding out the most appropriate type size for reading
continuous text is to determine limits. The smallest character size for
which reading is possible at maximum speed is called '[critical print
size]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#critical-print-size)'. At sizes smaller than this, reading speed gets much slower. The
critical print size depends on individuals, typefaces, and how you
measure it. There is also the difficulty discussed above that typefaces
of the same point size have different x-heights. Because the smallest or
optimal point size for legibility will depend on the typeface, some
research will be valid only for the particular typefaces used in the
studies.

A way to resolve this issue may have emerged from the collaboration
(mentioned previously) between the vision scientist and type designer
([Legge and Bigelow, 2011]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#legge-bigelow-2011)). They take various past studies and translate
the type sizes into measurements of the visual angles of the x-heights.
To make this accessible to designers, they describe what this would mean
in relation to a common typeface. They report that studies indicate that
the critical print size is an x-height of 0.2 degrees which is
equivalent to 9 point Times New Roman at a distance of 40 cm. This
happens to be consistent with Tinker finding that 9 point Granjon was
read as fast as larger sizes ([Tinker, 1963, p71]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#tinker-1963)). This convergence of a
minimum size for print is encouraging as different methods were used to
come to the same conclusion making the result more reliable. However, a
distinction should be made between the critical print size (minimum) and
the size that optimises reading performance. [Box 5.8](#box-5-8) gives more details
of the collaborative study.

<aside class="box expandable" id="box-5-8" markdown="1">

# Box 5.8: Details of study by vision scientist and type designer

This collaboration went further in bringing together typography and
psychology by considering whether the size of print we use today (and
historically) corresponds to the most appropriate size for fluent
reading. In other words, have we got it right in the past and present
without the specific scientific knowledge that we now have?

The research involves a survey of documents (published books,
newspapers, and typefounders' specimens) looking at the size of print
and comparing this to what we know about the
[psychophysics]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#psychophysics) of reading. They found that these sizes
fall within the range over which text can be read at maximum speed. They
conclude by proposing that the properties of human visual processing
play a dominant role in constraining the distribution of print sizes in
common use. Their conclusion supports an 
[ecological hypothesis]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#ecological-hypothesis) 
that decisions made by type
designers and typographers on type sizes have been determined by
properties of our vision.

I suspect that craft experience and practical design skills and training
encourage an awareness of the need to attend to perceptions of what we
design, not just the objects themselves. A key issue in the study of
perception (within psychology) is the potential for the lack of a
one-to-one relationship between a physical entity and its perception.
This can be best demonstrated with Rubin's vase ([Figure 5.21](#figure-5-21)). Do you
see a vase or faces?

On screen, a slightly larger size of 10 point seems to be required for
'[threshold legibility]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#threshold-legibility)', 
i.e. the smallest size that we can recognise
letters and words. The importance of x-height in relation to body size
was also found to be a factor in increasing legibility 
([Sheedy, Subbaram, Zimmerman and Hayes, 2005]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#sheedy-subbaram-zimmerman-hayes-2005)). For a given body size, Verdana was
the most legible and Times New Roman the least legible, with Arial and
Georgia intermediate in legibility (see [Figure 5.22](#figure-5-22)).

When speed of reading is measured, 12 point is read faster than 10
point, but the difference is relatively small. In this study by Bernard,
Lida, Riley, Hackler, and Janzen ([2002]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#bernard-lida-riley-hackler-janzen-2002)), 
the researchers found a
trade-off between speed and accuracy: the slightly faster reading of 12
point resulted in missing some of the deliberate errors (substituted
words) in the text. Some suggestion that there may be no advantage in
going above 10 point on screen when using Helvetica and Georgia comes
from an eye tracking study 
([Beymer, Russell, and Orton, 2008]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#beymer-russell-orton-2008)). 
But we must remember that the x-height of the typeface is likely to be the
determining factor.

All of the above research relates to adults. Children's reading books
typically use larger type sizes and generous line spacing and these both
reduce as reading age increases. The key is to ensure that differences
among letters are easy to discriminate at early ages so that the child
can focus on the other aspects of reading (deriving sound and meaning)
rather than perceptual processing, i.e. identifying the letters.

Tinker ([1965]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#tinker-1965)) proposed that by
about 10 years old children respond to
typographical arrangements in the same way as adults, therefore at that
age between 10 and 12 point type would be suitable. Sizes recommended
for younger children are:

-   between 14 to 18 point for 5–7 year olds

-   between 14 and 16 point for 7–9 year olds

-   about 12 point for 9–10 year olds

> Pregunta: Based on what you now know about how we read, can you suggest
why it may not be a good idea to continue using larger sizes beyond
about 10 years old?
{: .question }

Research seems to support the advantage of larger print for younger
children and some researchers argue that type sizes in children's
reading schemes could be larger than are currently employed 
([Hughes and Wilkins, 2000]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#hughes-wilkins-2000)).

## Type variants (bold and italic)

Traditional research indicates that text set all in italics slows down
reading; bold appears not to affect speed of reading continuous text and
can be perceived at a greater distance (summarised in [Tinker, 1963]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#tinker-1963), [1965]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#tinker-1965)). Typical 
practice and recommendations from well-regarded typographic books such as 
*The elements of typographic style*
([Bringhurst, 1992]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#bringhurst-1992)) is to 
use bold for setting titles, emphasising keywords etc., and to use italic as a 
means of differentiating words or
sentences within longer paragraphs. These differentiations can be
regarded as '[typographic cueing]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#typographic-cueing)' which can work
as an isolation effect, setting apart some information and making it
more likely to be noticed by readers.

Looking at how quickly we can recognise a word (by saying whether it is
a word or not a word — a non-word), bold words are responded to faster
than roman (using Bookman and Arial typefaces). This is particularly the
case if the word is uncommon (referred to as [low frequency](#sn:low-frequency))
([Macaya and Perea, 2014]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#macaya-perea-2014)).

<aside id="sn:low-frequency">
The authors interpret this result as indicating that bold affects how quickly we can get from the letter level to the word detector level where we match the letters against stored words (lexical access).
</aside>

It may seem that it is a good idea to use a bold font for setting whole
texts but some further evidence suggests that a distinction can be made
between a font's legibility and the [perceptual salience]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#perceptual-salience) 
of individual words ([Dyson and Beier, 2016]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#dyson-beier-2016)). 
This study explored switching between roman and different
variants to see which stylistic features (weight, width, contrast, and
italic) disrupt word recognition. We found that single bold words are
perceptually salient (i.e. stand out), but are not particularly legible
as a font. Switching from roman to italic, however, does not slow down
word recognition and suggests that words set in italic will therefore
not function as well as bold for emphasis. Bold seems to be more
appropriate than italic for setting headings or other access devices
through making words stand out.

## Typeface semantics

In [Chapter 1]({% link _chapters_en/1-what-do-we-mean-by-legibility.md %}) the 
idea of a typeface having a semantic role, as well as a
functional role, was introduced. Typefaces can be suited to particular
purposes not only because they are easy to read, but also because they
convey a meaning though their visual form, sometimes described as
personality. This is particularly relevant to marketing where brand
names in appropriate typefaces (i.e. consistent with the product) are
chosen more often than inappropriate ones (e.g. [Doyle and Bottomley, 2004]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#doyle-bottomley-2004), 
[2006]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#doyle-bottomley-2006)).

These two roles appear to be quite separate. A specific typeface might
be more or less appropriate for a particular context (e.g. shop sign,
wedding invitation, novel, textbook, annual report) but why would the
legibility of this typeface be affected by its personality? This
separation between legibility and aesthetics may not exist according to
a captivating study. This study shows that we respond to words more
slowly if the perceptual qualities of the font are inconsistent with the
meaning of the word, e.g. the word 'heavy' in a 'light' [font](#sn:light-dark) 
([Lewis and Walker, 1989]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#lewis-walker-1989)). 
[Figure 5.23](#figure-5-23)
illustrates words where the font is consistent or inconsistent with the
meaning of the word. The origins of this effect are described in [Box 5.9](#box-5-9).

<aside id="sn:light-dark">
This is interesting for the psychology of reading because it suggests that the typographic features of the letters and words have an influence at a semantic level, when we have accessed the meaning of the word.

</figure>

A more recent study confirms that using a font that is inconsistent with
the word's meaning ([Figure 5.24](#figure-5-24)) slows down decisions regarding the
emotion conveyed ([Hazlett, Larson, Shaikh, and Chaparro, 2013]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#hazlett-larson-shaikh-chaparro-2013)).
Therefore, legibility can be influenced by the meaning conveyed by the
typeface, although there does need to be quite a big difference between
the personalities of the typefaces for this to emerge.

# Box 5.9: Description and demonstration of the Stroop effect

Slowing responses when the font is inconsistent with the word's meaning
is related to a well-known interference effect: the Stroop effect
([Stroop, 1935/1992]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#stroop-1935-1992)). The participant is asked to name the colour and is
slower to respond if the word is inconsistent with the colour of the
ink. Have a go at the demonstration in [Figure 5.25](#figure-5-25).

</figure>

The tasks used in the two studies illustrated in [Figures 5.23](#figure-5-23) and [5.24](#figure-5-24)
are a reverse of the Stroop effect as participants are asked to respond
to the word's meaning (not the font).
</aside><!-- end .box#5-9 -->

Early studies described the connotations of typefaces as atmosphere
value ([Ovink, 1938]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#ovink-1938)) and congeniality ([Zachrisson, 1970]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#zachrisson-1970)). The
experimental approaches to determining the meaning have usually used
semantic differential scales (see description of Rating in [Panel 4.5]({% link _chapters_en/4-what-is-measured-and-how.md %}#panel-4-5)).
The dimensions that have emerged are:

-   Evaluative measuring the value or worth of items (e.g. good versus
    bad; beautiful versus ugly)

-   Potency measuring the strength (e.g. strong versus weak)

-   Activity measuring action (e.g. active versus passive; fast versus
    slow)

-   Mood measuring happiness (e.g. happy versus sad; relaxed versus
    tense)

The first three dimensions apply to many different types of things, e.g.
political parties or works of art, but mood has been found to be
particularly relevant to typefaces.

As typeface preferences and use change over time, it may be more helpful
to look at results from studies in terms of more general patterns rather
than the personalities of specific typefaces. Shaikh and Chaparro ([2016]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#shaikh-chaparro-2016))
report an online survey of 40 on-screen typefaces with trends showing:

-   Display typefaces that are bold, dark, block-like are viewed as
    stronger, less valuable, and more active (Broadway, Agency,
    Playbill)

-   Script typefaces are seen as less strong, more valuable, and less
    active (Vivaldi, French Script, Monotype Corsiva)

But we should note that there are also individual typefaces within a
category that deviate from these trends. [Figure 5.26](#figure-5-26) illustrates the
typefaces.

<figure id="figure-5-26" class="full">
    <img src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/figure-5-26.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Display typefaces compared with script typefaces">

</figure>

As we normally focus on reading, rather than examining the typeface, we
may not be conscious of typeface connotations. But if asked to judge the
appropriateness of a typeface for a particular type of text (e.g.
professional or friendly), readers are aware of consistencies or
inconsistencies ([Brumberger, 2003]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#brumberger-2003)).

We might expect typographers and graphic designers to be rather more
focused on the personality of typefaces. A couple of studies have found
some differences as to how the semantic qualities of typefaces are
perceived based on the level of experience of design, but non-designers
are able to perceive typeface connotations ([Tannenbaum, 1964]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#tannenbaum-jacobson-norris-1964)). There is
quite a lot of agreement between designers and non-designers but there
can also be pronounced differences on specific typefaces ([Bartram, 1982]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#bartram-1982)). 
For example, designers rate Futura as positive on the Evaluative
and Mood dimensions (e.g. beautiful, pleasant, good, happy, relaxed)
whereas non-designers rate Futura as negative on these same dimensions
(e.g. ugly, unpleasant, bad, sad, tense). Some caution should therefore
be taken in assuming that your own perceptions will be a perfect match
with all readers' perceptions.

> Pregunta: How would you go about checking that your choice of
typeface(s) for a project is perceived as appropriate by the readers?
{: .question }

Rather than determining the meaning of a typeface directly, a few
studies have looked at how the content of a text may be influenced by
the typeface. Satirical articles on government issues and education
policy set in Times New Roman were perceived as more satirical (angry
and funny) than the same texts in Arial ([Juni and Gross, 2008]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#juni-gross-2008)). However,
this was not a very strong effect and an earlier study failed to show
that the typeface can influence how the text content was perceived
([Brumberger, 2003]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#brumberger-2003)).

In the context of a job application, consideration should be given to
the choice of typeface. Three identical resumés (CVs) set in three
different typefaces (see [Figure 5.27](#figure-5-27)) can affect how an applicant is
perceived ([Shaikh and Fox, 2008]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#shaikh-fox-2008)).

</aside>

Despite the relevance of typeface connotations to choosing a typeface
for a specific purpose, legibility is more important as a criterion of
appropriateness than consistency for text-heavy document types 
([Shaikh and Chaparro, 2016]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#shaikh-chaparro-2016)). Readers are aware of the value of ease of reading.

# Letter spacing

In [Chapter 2]({% link _chapters_en/2-how-we-read.md %}) I introduced 'crowding' which refers to the effect of
surrounding letters in words on the ease of identifying letters. It is
easier to identify single letters if they are not in a word because the
adjacent letters can jumble the appearance of letters. This suggests
that increasing the space between letters would improve word
identification, due to making it easier to identify the individual
letters and accurately locate their position in relation to one another
(e.g. to avoid confusing casual and causal). But if too much space is
used, the letters may not be perceived as a group, i.e. a word. Another
possible disadvantage of increasing letter spacing is that upcoming
words, those we are about to read that are in our parafoveal vision,
will be even further away from our fixation and therefore our acuity
will be reduced.

A font has character widths (including space) built into it and most
text processing software will have some way of adjusting the letter
spacing from the default (0) value. Research exploring deviations from
the defaults has produced the consistent finding that tightening
(decreasing) letter spacing makes reading more difficult. However,
increasing spacing has resulted in contradictory results: either no
benefits or some benefit. This divergence can be explained by
differences in readers, typefaces, method of testing, and amount of
spacing.

Studies which use Courier, a monospaced typeface, found that tighter
than standard spacing reduced reading speed but increasing beyond the
standard did not increase reading speed ([Chung, 2002]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#chung-2002); 
[Yu, Cheung, Legge, and Chung, 2007]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#yu-cheung-legge-chung-2007)). There was no evidence that the effect of crowding was
reduced by increasing beyond the standard spacing. Using Courier is an
odd choice from a designer's perspective but it is easier to specify and
manipulate space with each letter occupying the same fixed width.
However, this property may be the reason why there is no advantage to
increasing letter spacing beyond standard. Monospacing (fixed width)
results in looser spacing, particularly for narrower letters, and
therefore might not need additional spacing, particularly as this means
that words will extend further into our peripheral vision ([Figure 5.28](#figure-5-28)).
The adjustments to letter spacing are also rather large compared with
later studies.

    <img src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/figure-5-28.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Monospace width default">

standard spacing appears quite loose.

More recent studies have included adult skilled readers, young readers
(7–8 and 9–10 year olds) and young readers with [developmental dyslexia]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#developmental-dyslexia). Words set in 14 point Times New
Roman with additional spacing (see [Figure 5.29](#figure-5-29)) are identified faster
than the default spacing. This is true for all three sets of readers.
However, when a reading task is used (not just single words) the
advantage for wider spacing is only found with dyslexic readers. The
reason why these different groups of readers were compared is because
crowding tends to be greater for younger readers compared to adults and
greater for dyslexics than normal readers ([Perea, Moret-Tatay, and Gómez, 2011]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#perea-moret-tatay-gomez-2011); 
[Perea, Panadero, Moret-Tatay, and Gómez, 2012]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#perea-panadero-moret-tatay-gomez-2012)).

</figcaption>
</figure>

This relationship between increased crowding and spacing has been
further explored by measuring the extent of crowding in individuals and
looking at the corresponding effect of increasing letter, word, and line
spacing ([Joo, White, Strodtman, and Yeatman, 2018]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#joo-white-strodtman-yeatman-2018)). Normal spacing
consisted of words set in 11 point Calibri and spacing was increased by
using 11 point Fluent Calibri (see [Figure 5.30](#figure-5-30)). A sub-group of adults
with dyslexia who showed greater effects of crowding read faster with
the additional spacing. This study did not determine whether letter,
word, or line spacing is responsible for improving reading performance.

When 5–7 year old children were tested in a more natural reading
environment, changes in letter spacing from tight to very wide had no
effect on reading rate or errors ([Reynolds and Walker, 2004]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#reynolds-walker-2004)). The
children were asked to read aloud from a text set in 19 point Century
Educational typeface which is used by publishers of early readers
children's books.

With adult readers and more subtle changes in letter spacing (see [Figure 5.31](#figure-5-31)), 
responses get faster as spacing increases. Reading sentences, we
fixate for a shorter time if there is more spacing 
([Perea and Gómez, 2012a]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#perea-gomez-2012a), [2012b]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#perea-gomez-2012b)). 
However, when adults read in a more natural context
(reading stories for comprehension), there is no difference in overall
reading time between default spacing and expanded spacing (1.2), as in
[Figure 5.29](#figure-5-29) ([Perea, Giner, Marcet, and Gomez, 2016]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#perea-giner-marcet-gomez-2016)). 
Although fixations
are shorter with the extra space between letters, slightly more
fixations are made which cancels out the advantage. The saccade length
is similar in the default and expanded spacings. As we are used to
reading the default setting, and initiating saccades of a specific
length, the question remains as to whether we might adjust the number of
fixations if we read the expanded text for longer.

Research has confirmed that relatively small adjustments to letter
spacing will affect single word recognition in different ways depending
on whether the typeface is proportional or fixed width 
([Slattery, Yates, and Angele, 2016]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#slattery-yates-angele-2016)). When letter spacing is increased:

-   Words in proportional width typefaces (Calibri, Cambria, Georgia,
    and Verdana) are responded to faster.

-   Words in fixed width typefaces (Consolas and Courier New) are
    responded to slower. This confirms the earlier studies described
    above which also used Courier.

This study found no differences between serif and sans serif typefaces.
This may be because the default spacings are adjusted appropriately (see
[Figure 5.32](#figure-5-32)).

In summary, there is some evidence that slightly looser letter spacing
helps dyslexic readers and possibly other readers, but this will depend
on the typeface. E-books might therefore benefit from including control
over letter spacing, particularly for dyslexic readers. Adults spend
less time on individual fixations with looser spacing but more fixations
are made. It therefore looks as though the defaults determined by type
designers are appropriate even though they are not based on empirical
research.

# Word spacing 

In the studies above where sentences were read, word spacing increased
when letter spacing increased. Microsoft Word also automatically adjusts
spaces between words when the user changes letter spacing (see, for
example, [Figure 5.31](#figure-5-31)).

Word spaces allow us to segment text into words and help us target where
to land our eyes, based on parafoveal vision. The space before the first
letter of a word and space after the last letter also reduce crowding
effects. All of these factors argue for having quite large word spaces.
But there is a disadvantage as increasing word spaces pushes words
further into our peripheral vision where our acuity drops off sharply.
If letter spacing is reduced but word spacing increased, upcoming words
are not pushed further into peripheral vision (see [Figure 5.33](#figure-5-33)). One
study which used these spacings with Georgia and Consolas (a fixed width
sans serif) found a benefit from reducing letter spacing (a little) and
increasing word spacing. However, this was mainly with Georgia, rather
than Consolas, which can be explained by the default spacings (see
[Figure 5.32](#figure-5-32)). Georgia has tighter word spacing and so can benefit more
from an increase than Consolas 
([Slattery and Rayner, 2013]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#slattery-rayner-2013)).

<figure id="figure-5-33">
    <img src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/figure-5-33.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Relationship between letter and word spacing">
    <figcaption class="aside"><strong>Figura 5.33:</strong> The top sentence in each pair has the default letter and
word spacing. The bottom sentence in each pair has reduced letter
spacing and increased word spacing. The top pair uses the typeface
Georgia and the bottom pair is in Consolas.</figcaption>
</figure>

This relationship between word and letter spacing was explored further
by Slattery, Yates, and Angele ([2016]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#slattery-yates-angele-2016)) using Calibri and Consolas to
compare proportional and fixed width typefaces. They confirm the
importance of considering letter and word spacing together and propose
that spaces between words should be at least 3.5 times the spaces
between letters for efficient reading. As with letter spacing, fixed
width Consolas is read slower if word spacing is larger than default,
unless letter spacing is reduced. Calibri is read slower if word spacing
is reduced. Although this study involved reading sentences, the
researchers point out that only single lines of text were used and more
research is required using multiple lines.

In summary, when making adjustments to word spacing:

-   defaults built into different fonts and page layout software need to
    be taken into account

-   the relationship between letter and word spacing is important

-   characteristics of readers may be particularly relevant as younger
    readers and dyslexics are more susceptible to crowding effects

# Alignment

Paragraphs of text are typically aligned on the left with the right
margin either aligned to produce justified text or with a ragged right
margin to produce unjustified text. Most studies have shown no
differences in reading speed although fully justified text may be
problematic for poor readers when set in short lines, i.e. 7 words per
line, about 42 characters (see [Figure 5.34](#figure-5-34)) or even slightly longer,
about 52 characters ([Gregory and Poulton, 1970]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#gregory-poulton-1970); [Zachrisson, 1965]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#zachrisson-1965)). One
study has looked at alignment in web pages but using a search for a link
in a screen of text, rather than reading the text. Performance was
better with left-aligned then justified text although participants
preferred justified ([Ling and van Schaik, 2007]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#ling-van-schaik-2007)).

<figure id="figure-5-34">
    <img src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/figure-5-34.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Justified and unjustified text setting">
    <figcaption class="aside"><strong>Figura 5.34:</strong> Short lines set in justified (top) and unjustified (bottom)
setting.</figcaption>
</figure>

The main reason proposed for the reduced legibility of justified text is
the uneven spacing, often described as 'rivers' of white. These larger
word spaces are more likely to occur with:

-   short lines

-   lots of long words

-   wider characters

-   no hyphenation

-   less sophisticated control over word (and letter) spacing

The assumption is that eye movements will be adversely affected by this
unevenness which might be due to the lack of rhythm. Another possible
explanation is that larger word spaces push forthcoming words further
into peripheral vision, reducing their acuity. These factors may be more
important for poorer readers who have a smaller [perceptual span]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#perceptual-span) (and who therefore make use of fewer letters to
the right). These proposed explanations have not been tested, as far as
I know. It is possible that the issue is not differences in legibility
but [aesthetic considerations.](#sn:aesthetic-considerations)

<aside id="sn:aesthetic-considerations" markdown="1">

Vertical rivers, where interword spaces line up with each other on successive lines, may not be a problem except aesthetically. Studies of eye movements suggest that we don’t use the text of the next line to preview what is coming next ([Pollatsek, Raney, Lagasse, and Rayner, 1993]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#pollatsek-raney-lagasse-rayner-1993)). I am not entirely certain who first used the term ‘rivers’ but it occurs in Dowding ([1966, p5]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#dowding-1966)), who also refers to aesthetic considerations, rather than legibility.

# Line length

Line length, sometimes described as line width, can be measured by:

-   physical length of the line (e.g. 15 centimetres), sometimes
    converted to visual angle by taking into account the viewing
    distance

-   number of characters per line (cpl) which can be varied by\
    1) changing type size, keeping physical length constant, or\
    2) keeping type size constant which varies physical length

    [Figure 5.35](#figure-5-35) shows the various ways of changing line lengths.

<figure id="figure-5-35" class="full">
    <img src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/figure-5-35.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Line length and type size">
    <figcaption><strong>Figura 5.35:</strong> Examples showing the relationship between physical line
length, number of characters per line, and type size. Top and middle:
same physical length but smaller type size in middle increases number of
characters per line. Top and bottom: same number of characters per line but physical length
varies because of type size.</figcaption>
</figure>

Research into the relative legibility of different line lengths in print
has led to recommendations that line lengths should not exceed about 70
cpl ([Spencer, 1968]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#spencer-1968)). Various studies summarised in Tinker ([1963]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#tinker-1963)) have
been interpreted as supporting an optimal line length of 52 cpl 
([Rayner and Pollatsek, 1989, p118]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#rayner-pollatsek-1989)). 
The explanation given for the legibility of
this moderate line length is that it is the outcome of a trade-off
between two opposing factors. If line lengths are too long, the return
sweeps to the beginning of the next line can be inaccurate. If the lines
are too short, readers cannot make maximum use of their peripheral
vision. However, [recent studies](https://designregression.com/article/line-length-revisited-following-the-research)
have questioned whether inaccurate return sweeps are necessarily
problematic.

Studies looking at line length on screen began in the 1980s but were
constrained as to how they could change line length. They did this by
changing the character density which meant characters of the same height
but different widths, looking something like [Figure 5.36](#figure-5-36).

<figure id="figure-5-36" class="full">
    <img src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/figure-5-36.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Different character densities">
    <figcaption><strong>Figura 5.36:</strong> A simulation of different character densities used in the
1980s to change type size and therefore number of characters per line.</figcaption>
</figure>

An early study showed that smaller characters, with more characters per
line (bottom of [Figure 5.36](#figure-5-36)) are read faster and more efficiently with
fewer fixations overall ([Kolers, Duchnicky, and Ferguson, 1981]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#kolers-duchnicky-ferguson-1981)). The
line lengths compared were 35 and 70 cpl. Around 20 years later, using
updated screen technology, line length was varied by changing the number
of characters of the same size ([Figure 5.37](#figure-5-37)). The study found that
reading rate tended to get faster as lines got longer, surprisingly even
up to 100 cpl ([Dyson, 2004]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#dyson-2004), 
[2005]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#dyson-2005)). Similar advantages for longer lines
on screen were found when searching for words, rather than continuous
reading ([Youngman and Scharff, 1998]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#youngman-scharff-1998); 
[Ling and van Schaik, 2006]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#ling-van-schaik-2006)).

<figure id="figure-5-37" class="full">
    <img src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/figure-5-37.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Different line lengths">
    <figcaption><strong>Figura 5.37:</strong> Three line lengths used by Dyson in various studies which
change the number of characters, keeping type size (and line spacing)
constant. The left is 25 cpl, the middle 55 cpl, and the right 100 cpl.</figcaption>
</figure>

However, a consistent finding is that long line lengths on screen are
least preferred or judged as least easy to read. Moderate line lengths
(around 50–70 cpl) are preferred which fits with preferences for line
lengths in print. This makes sense as readers may make similar
judgements regardless of whether they are reading print or from screen.
Readers may also be judging what they frequently encounter in printed
material as being easiest to read, i.e. familiarity determining
perceived legibility. But why might there be an advantage in reading
speed for long lines (up to around 100 characters) on screen whereas in
print, a maximum of 70 characters is most legible? Here are some
suggestions:

-   The subjective judgements might provide a hint. Long line lengths on
    screen look quite daunting and this may encourage faster less
    detailed reading, such as scanning or skimming. This is consistent
    with comprehension being poorer with long line lengths, compared
    with moderate length lines. In fact, Ling and van Schaik ([2006]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#ling-van-schaik-2006))
    suggest that longer line lengths should be used for quick scanning
    and shorter lines when text needs to be read more thoroughly.

-   The mechanics of reading texts on screen might also influence
    reading time. If required to scroll through texts, a longer line
    length will require less scrolling as there will be fewer lines. If
    we read whilst scrolling, we won't be slowed down by greater amounts
    of scrolling. If we don't, long line lengths will be more [efficient to navigate.](#sn:long-line-lengths)

-   A question remains as to why long lines might be less problematic in
    terms of the accuracy of the return sweep from the end of one line
    to the beginning of the next. As mentioned above, we tend to sit
    further away from a desktop computer screen than printed material
    which means that a line of text has a smaller visual angle. This
    smaller visual angle may make it easier to locate the correct
    position for our eyes when we do a return sweep. Another possible
    explanation is that the scrolling provides a cue to locating the
    next line, the upward movement of text reducing the difficulty with
    long lines. However, this is only likely to work if we scroll
    slowly, and may therefore be less relevant to touchscreen interfaces
    used on smartphones or tablets.

> Pregunta: Are you convinced by any of the above suggestions? If you
encounter a long line length on the screen of a desktop computer, do you
adjust the settings? If so, why do you do this? Are you influenced by
what you read in print?
{: .question }

<aside id="sn:long-line-lengths">
The studies underpinning this discussion were carried out with desktop computers and scrolling using up and down cursor or arrow keys (see image). However, the formatting of text (line length and hence number of lines) is also relevant to scrolling through text on mobile devices.

</aside>

## Columns

Another means of varying line length is to set text in columns: multiple
columns generally result in shorter line lengths. There are a few
studies which have directly compared single and multiple columns in
print. The context for much of this research was exploring academic
printed journal designs which typically use multiple column formats. The
findings were not entirely consistent:

-   an advantage for narrow column setting ([Foster, 1970]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#foster-1970))

-   single columns read faster than double columns ([Poulton, 1959]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#poulton-1959))

-   no difference between a single column and double column ([Hartley, Burnhill, and Fraser, 1974]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#hartley-burnhill-fraser-1974))

-   with children aged around 11–12 years old there was slightly faster
    scanning for items in two columns (around 53 cpl) compared to one
    column (around 115 cpl). However, the longer line length was not
    problematic ([Hartley, Burnhill, and Davis, 1978]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#hartley-burnhill-davis-1978)).

In the early days of online versions of newspapers and magazines, column
formats were typically used on the web, often as PDFs, until these were
re-designed and tailored for screen viewing. In a comparison of one and
three columns on screen ([Figure 5.38](#figure-5-38)), the single column (80 cpl) was
read faster with no differences in comprehension ([Dyson and Kipping,
1997]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#dyson-kipping-1997). This provides further support for the advantage of longer lines
[described above.](#sn:longer-lines)

<aside id="sn:longer-lines">
This study included two versions of the single column: one which used scrolling to move through the text and one which used a single keystroke to get to the next screenful of text (described as ‘paged’). The three-column format was presented only in a paged version as columns can only practically be read to the bottom of the screen. The single column using paging was the one read fastest.
</aside>

Some interesting additional findings from the Dyson and Kipping study
are:

-   The advantage for this single column was restricted to a younger age
    group (18–24 year olds). Those over 25 years old read each version
    at a similar speed. We surmised that the younger participants were
    more familiar with reading web pages (around 1997).

-   Comprehension was better for faster readers in the three-column
    version than for slower readers. We speculated that faster readers
    may use a different reading pattern and be able to scan narrow
    columns in an efficient manner to absorb information.

# Line spacing

A very early study indicated that increasing line space from no
additional space (same as point size) to 7 points additional space led
to faster reading; with more than 7 points, reading slowed down
([Bentley, 1921]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#bentley-1921)). As the type sizes used were 6, 9 and 12 point, this is
rather generous use of line space (see [Figure 5.39](#figure-5-39)).

<figure id="figure-5-39">
    <img src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/figure-5-39.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="An indication of the material used by Bentley">

additional line space. The bottom row has the same sizes with <span class="clarification" title="Illustration not to scale">7 points</span> additional space.

</figcaption>
</figure>

As discussed in [Chapter 4]({% link _chapters_en/4-what-is-measured-and-how.md %}), 
designers do not make decisions on individual
typographic variables, but consider the relationship between these
variables. The legibility of a particular line length may be influenced
by the amount of line spacing. The problem of inaccurate return sweeps
when reading a long line may be alleviated by introducing more space
between the lines. Paterson and Tinker studied type size, line length
and line spacing of print by systematically varying all three
(summarised in [Tinker, 1965]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#tinker-1965)). 
The results were expressed as 'safety
zones' referring to limits of line length and line spacing within which
legibility would be satisfactory. These were generally between 1 and 4
points with not too much variation according to line length or type
size. What we may conclude from this is that line spacing should not be
too tight. Different typefaces are also perceived as needing different
amounts of line spacing to maximise their attractiveness or appeal for
reading with sans serif and italic needing one point more than serif
roman typefaces ([Becker, Heinrich, von Sichowsky, and Wendt, 1970]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#becker-heinrich-von-sichowsky-wendt-1970)).

Such extensive research has not been carried out for reading from
screen. Given the rather general outcomes, it is questionable as to
whether it would be worth repeating for screen. One study with the
objective of generating design guidelines for web pages compared Arial
10 point type set in single, 1.5 or double line spacing. The researchers
found that the greater the line space, the better able participants were
to locate hyperlinks within texts and their preferences also followed
this pattern ([Ling and van Schaik, 2007]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#ling-van-schaik-2007)).

Locating hyperlinks is an information retrieval task which will not
involve the same sequence of eye movements as continuous reading. It is
plausible that words are more easily identified when there is more space
above and below them. This seems to be confirmed by a study which looked
at line spacing from the perspective of crowding ([Chung, 2004]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#chung-2004)). Crowding
has been discussed above in terms of letter and word spacing, i.e.
horizontal space, whereas this study looked at vertical space which
designers call line spacing. The study looked at the speed of
identifying words and the results indicated that an increase in space
above and below words increased reading speed. If we look directly at
the word so that it falls onto the fovea, we benefit from increases of
about 1.25 to 1.5 the standard spacing (see [Figure 5.40](#figure-5-40)) and after that
there is no additional benefit. However, for words in peripheral vision
which we use to guide where we land our eyes following a saccade, even
greater line spacing is beneficial. These effects are greater for
smaller type sizes suggesting that line spacing should not be set at a
consistent percentage of type size; small sizes need relatively more
additional space. Although Tinker's method and approach were very
different, and the results expressed in a different way, there is some
agreement with the crowding conclusions.

    <img src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/figure-5-40.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Different line space">

**Figura 5.40:** Variations in space above and below words (line space) used
by Chung ([2004]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#chung-2004)). The study found that 1.25x to 1.5x the standard spacing
(1x) increased the speed of identifying the middle word (bike).

</figcaption>
</figure>

These studies indicate that optimal line spacing may be similar in print
and on screen. The benefits of generous spacing may be an aid to
improving the accuracy of return sweeps in longer lines, but also a
means of alleviating crowding from adjacent lines.

# Paragraph denotation

The typical ways of denoting paragraphs are:

-   space between paragraphs

-   indented first line

-   new line but no indent

-   occasionally, indented first line and space between paragraphs

The first three of these formats plus no denotation have been compared
with 11–12 year olds scanning a text for missing words 
([Hartley, Burnhill, and Davis, 1978]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#hartley-burnhill-davis-1978)). They found:

-   the version with space between paragraphs (1 in [Figure 5.41](#figure-5-41)) is
    scanned faster than the new line with no indent (3) and no
    denotation (4)

-   the version with additional space between paragraphs (1) is not
    scanned significantly faster than paragraphs denoted by an indent
    (2)

They conclude that as an indent uses less space, this is a more
cost-effective solution for print.

There does not appear to be any research which has pursued ways of
denoting paragraphs on screen. The cost is not a factor and typically
space is used to separate paragraphs (as in 1).

# Headings

Headings have the function of structuring a text, signalling the topic
covered in the following text, and providing an access point (i.e. to
locate a particular section). To serve these purposes, headings need to
be differentiated from surrounding text. Earlier in this chapter, bold
was considered as more appropriate than italic as a means of making
words stand out. Comparing all capitals and bold, newspaper headlines
were found to be located faster in bold lower case than all capitals
([Poulton, 1967]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#poulton-1967)). The lower case x-height was matched to the height of
capital letters as the typographic designer involved in this study
considered these to be optimal for the setting (see [Figure 5.19](#figure-5-19)). The
capitals were set at the size that were in current use in the newspaper.
This approach was in keeping with the practical purpose of the research
which was carried out at the request of the editor of *The Times*
newspaper.

Research comparing different graphic treatments of headings is however
very limited and there has been more emphasis on the linguistic function
of headings in facilitating processing of text and improving recall
(e.g. [Hyönä and Lorch, 2004]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#hyona-lorch-2004)). We do know that the position of headings
(embedded or in the margin) did not matter for 14–15 year olds 
([Hartley and Trueman, 1983]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#hartley-trueman-1983)). ([Figure 5.42](#figure-5-42)) We might therefore conclude that the
two solutions are similar in terms of usability.

<figure id="figure-5-42">
    <img src="{{ 'assets/illustrations/figure-5-42.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Position of headings">
    <figcaption class="aside" markdown="1">
    
**Figura 5.42:** Two positions of headings used by Hartley and Trueman ([1983]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#hartley-trueman-1983)): embedded (top) and in the margin (bottom).

</figcaption>
</figure>

One study took a different approach to identifying the most appropriate
typography for headings in text by exploring how easy it is to visually
discriminate among them using a set of cards 
([Williams and Spyridakis, 1992]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#williams-spyridakis-1992)). They measured the time required to place 16 different heading
treatments in order of importance. The assumption is that if we can do
this quickly, this suggests that the headings are clearly different from
each other and consequently, they would work in a text to indicate the
hierarchical structure. The treatments used type size, position
(centred, flush left, indented, embedded), underlining, and case. Type
size was perceived as the most powerful cue to the hierarchical status
of the heading, which is understandable as there is little ambiguity in
this treatment: a larger heading means a higher level of heading. A more
subtle finding is that their participants found it easier to make
judgements when the headings varied along fewer dimensions (e.g. size
alone versus size and position).

Some care should be taken in applying these results to practice as
headings need to be differentiated from body text as well as from [other
headings.](#sn:other-headings) It may therefore
be desirable to change at least two dimensions to identify headings
(e.g. size, case, typeface or type variant) and indicate the hierarchy
of headings through one change, possibly size. There may be an
interesting difference in which variable is used in different countries.
In Mexico, upper case is frequently used for headings.

<aside id="sn:other-headings" markdown="1">

Williams and Spyridakis ([1992]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#williams-spyridakis-1992)) are aware of the difference between

- determining whether headings are the same or different, where variation on more dimensions will look more dissimilar

- how headings relate to each other and interpreting whether size is more important than position, case or underlining

But their test material may have lost sight of normal practice, which would not use 16 levels of heading and headings as large as 57 points.
</aside>

The space above and below headings appears not to have been specifically
investigated in an empirical study but the Gestalt laws of grouping and
organisation can inform practice ([Panel 5.4](#panel-5-4)). The Gestalt law of
proximity states that elements positioned closer together are seen as a
group and perceived to be more closely related than other elements in
the image or display. Headings need to be seen to relate to the text
below, rather than float between paragraphs or appear to group with the
text above. To enable this grouping, there needs to be more space above
a heading than below ([Figure 5.43](#figure-5-43)).

heading is closer to the text above and therefore does not appear to be
part of the following paragraph.</figcaption>

# Panel 5.4: Description of Gestalt psychology

Gestalt psychology stems from a German philosophy of the mind and is
associated with Wertheimer ([1923]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#wertheimer-1923)), 
Koffka ([1935]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#koffka-1935)) and 
Köhler ([1947]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#kohler-1947)). You
may have heard the famous phrase 'The whole is *greater* than the sum of
the parts'. This happens to be a mistranslation and should be 'The whole
is *other* than the sum of the parts'. What is meant is that the Gestalt
(shape or form or configuration) that we perceive is different from the
separate parts. This maxim should resonate with designers as we know
that typographic variables interact and need to be considered in
relation to one another.

Other than the law of proximity, there are laws of good continuation,
common fate, similarity, and Prägnanz or simplicity. The law of
simplicity says that we will perceive ambiguous or complex images as the
simplest form possible. This law is a good example of why Gestalt
psychology has been criticised by vision researchers. What is meant by a
simple form? This is a vague qualitative description that seems to evade
measurement. How do we measure what is simplest? One way is described in
[Panel 5.3](#panel-5-3). There are now some quantitative approaches to Gestalt
perception but as yet, the studies' results are diverse and
heterogeneous with little theoretical coherence 
([Jäkel, Singh, Wichmann, and Herzog, 2016]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#jakel-singh-wichmann-herzog-2016)). 
We are therefore left with an intuitively appealing
demonstration ([Figure 5.43](#figure-5-43)) that space can be used in typography to
support processing of text without any supporting evidence. The
demonstration works because we are encouraged to perceive a specific
grouping and it makes sense to do so — the demonstration is convincing.

# Overall layout

Some studies have taken a global approach by looking at layouts which
vary a number of different features, acknowledging the importance of the
relationship between typographic variables. Two approaches have been
used:

-   identifying dimensions, [constructs]({% link pages/glossary_en.md %}#construct) or variables used
    to make judgements

-   measuring the effects of 'good' and 'poor' layouts

## Identifying dimensions, constructs or variables

A study ([Grabinger, 1993]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#grabinger-1993)) 
aiming to identify constructs which would
inform the design of screens used a notation system of `x`s and `o`s
([Twyman, 1981]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#twyman-1981)) to present 
examples to participants ([Figure 5.44](#figure-5-44)). The
typographic variables tested included various combinations of line
length, number of columns, line spacing, and paragraph denotation.
Participants judged the readability and studyability of the screens
using paired comparisons (see [Chapter 4]({% link _chapters_en/4-what-is-measured-and-how.md %})). 
The results indicated that the
organisation of screens and their visual interest were relevant to
judgements and single spacing and two columns resulted in more positive
judgements. Because a number of variables differed across screens, the
individual contribution of line spacing and number of columns cannot be
identified.

## Effects of good and poor layout

A number of studies have tested different versions of documents that are
assumed to differ in legibility, based on previous research and
guidelines. Two such studies comparing screen formats found no
differences in performance measures but preference for an 'enhanced'
format ([Muter and Maurutto, 1991]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#muter-maurutto-1991)) 
or a 'well-structured' text layout 
([de Bruijn, de Mul, and van Oostendorp, 1992]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#de-bruijn-de-mul-van-oostendorp-1992)). 
A later study ([Chaparro, Shaikh, and Baker, 2005]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#chaparro-shaikh-baker-2005)) 
also looking at screens resulted in the same
outcome: no difference in reading speed or comprehension but an enhanced
layout was preferred, regarded as less tiring to read, and satisfaction
scores were higher.

One recent study from an undergraduate dissertation at the University of
Reading, UK ([Moys, Loveland, and Dyson, 2018]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#moys-loveland-dyson-2018)) 
did find performance
differences between layouts varying in typographic quality. The 'good'
layout was read faster and there were differences in the accuracy of
recall. The results of this study are intriguing because the differences
in recall depend on whether the participants read print or eInk
(Kindle). The screen (eInk) version is as we would expect: more correct
answers when the layout is better. But the print version reverses this
result: recall is better with a poor layout. There is a possible
explanation as to why a poor layout improves performance (introduced in
[Chapter 6]({% link _chapters_en/6-beyond-legibility-research.md %})) 
but it is difficult to explain why the results are different
for eInk and print.

> Pregunta: Do you have any suggestions as to why the results are
different?
{: .question }

Setting aside the lack of explanation for the outcomes, the study by
Moys, Loveland, and Dyson ([2018]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#moys-loveland-dyson-2018)) 
found differences in both reading speed
and recall, unlike the earlier studies. What might explain this
divergence? The studies vary in many ways but the most obvious reason is
likely to be the design of the test material. Unlike most of the
research summarised earlier in this chapter which focuses on one
typographic variable, these formats or layouts require the researchers
to produce well-designed material as well as the, arguably, easier task
of producing poorly designed material. Design guidelines need to be
interpreted and decisions made as to how to combine variables. As
discussed in [Chapter 4]({% link _chapters_en/4-what-is-measured-and-how.md %}), if the researchers lack design training, this is
not an easy task.

The studies conducted in the 1990s did not illustrate their test
material, which we know is fairly typical. Consequently, it is difficult
to state with any certainty that the materials used were not appropriate
exemplars of good and bad layouts. However, Muter and Maurutto ([1991]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#muter-maurutto-1991))
suggest that some of their 'enhancements' may have had a negative
effect, for example indenting every other line (see [Figure 5.45](#figure-5-45),
bottom). This lack of a consistent left margin would probably create
problems with return sweeps of the eyes.

The later study ([Chaparro, Shaikh, and Baker, 2005]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#chaparro-shaikh-baker-2005)) does include
examples of 'enhanced' and 'poor' layouts which were created by 'expert
typographers'. An indication of the layouts is given in [Figure 5.46](#figure-5-46). The
most evident aspect of poor practice is the splitting of text around an
image. In this case, the measures of performance may not have been
sufficiently sensitive to detect differences. For example, participants
were able to go back to the passages to look up the answers to
comprehension questions, with some time constraint. This is much easier
than needing to recall what has been read.

The test material used in Moys, Loveland, and Dyson ([2018]({% link pages/bibliography_en.md %}#moys-loveland-dyson-2018)) was also
designed by someone with typographic training (the student author,
Loveland) and varied alignment, character spacing, line spacing, and
line length. The exact same typographic treatments were not implemented
for print and eInk. This would have caused both to have sub-optimal
typography, when the aim was good typography, and so would have been an
unnecessary compromise. Suitable typography for each was therefore used.
Poor typography used justified text (to introduce inconsistencies in
word spacing) tighter letter spacing, greater line spacing, and a
substantially longer line length (see [Figure 5.47](#figure-5-47)). The optimisation of
the layouts for the good examples, and manipulation of many typographic
attributes in creating the poor layout, may account for the differences
in performance. Also, a delay was introduced between reading the text
and answering multiple choice questions (without referring back to the
texts) which may have increased the sensitivity of this measure.

Despite the positive reasons for including multiple variables together
in one study, most of the outcomes have rather limited value in
informing us of how to design to optimise legibility. They do indicate
that participants (readers) can judge which layouts are better, or
rather their judgements agree with the researchers' judgements.

> Questions: Explain the difference between participants' ability to judge
which layouts are more legible and their judgements agreeing with
researchers'. Why might this distinction be important?

# Summary

This chapter has a large section on type which can make it seem the most
important aspect of legibility. However, we should not forget that the
way in which typographic and graphic designers *use* type is crucially
important to ease of reading. Beginning this chapter with research on
type signals that reading starts with identifying letters.

This overview is not exhaustive as there are factors which affect
legibility, such as contrast of type to background, reversed out type,
and size of margins, which have not been covered. I do not have a clear
rationale for excluding these, other than to suggest that the research
is rather limited and seems less relevant to current practice.

You will probably also have noticed that there are varying amounts of
research depending on the typographic attribute or variable. I would not
say that I have covered every research study but this unevenness
probably does mirror, to a reasonable extent, the relative volume of
work in each area. We might, therefore, ask why isn't there much work on
paragraph denotation? I can speculate that because the research that
exists does not show any differences, it is of less interest to other
researchers. Unlike some areas of research which can inform models and
theories of reading or overlap with other disciplines, the treatment of
paragraphs has direct application to design practice but little
theoretical significance. It is therefore falls to applied researchers
to pursue this topic. In other areas, valuable insights emerge from
combining results from different types of researchers with different
objectives.

Along with the uneven coverage, there are discrepancies in the
reliability and informativeness of the research. This is particularly
the case where little research exists or there are contradictory
results. In such cases, you may be left to make up your own mind about
what to take away from the overview, but I hope I have provided some
guidance.

In researching for this text, I was excited to discover a very large
number of studies published by a Spanish Professor of Psychology at the
University of Valencia: Manuel Perea. You will have seen his name cited
quite a few times in the overview. This research encouraged me as the
majority of legibility studies have been carried out in English and with
participants who are familiar with typographic conventions in the UK or
US. In a couple of places in this text, I have mentioned conventions
that may differ in Mexico (thanks to my editor). Although the studies by
Perea are done in Spain, they are extending the generality of the
results to the Spanish language and Perea is keen to consider any
possible influence of the language on the results (though not the
typographic conventions).

Along with his fellow researchers, Perea has recognised the potential
importance of typographic factors in reading and explored:

-   upper versus lower case

-   interletter spacing

-   upper versus lower halves of letters

-   bold type

-   serif versus sans serif

I am therefore hopeful that this recent interest from various groups of
researchers encourages others to delve further into the effects of
typography on reading to inform practitioners.
